in 1927 a zoological garden -lrb- ogród zoologiczny -rrb- was established on the park grounds , and in 1952 a bear run , still open today . 
the species richness is mainly due to the location of warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas -lrb- natural forests , wetlands along the vistula -rrb- as well as arable land , meadows and forests .

the first remedial measure was the warsaw area enlargement -lrb- 1951 -rrb- -- but the city authorities were still forced to introduce residency registration limitations : only the spouses and children of the permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance -lrb- like renowned specialists -rrb- were allowed to get the registration , hence halving the population growth in the following years . 
it also bolstered some kind of conviction among poles that varsovians thought of themselves as better only because they lived in the capital . 
unfortunately this belief still lives on in poland -lrb- although not as much as it used to be -rrb- -- even though since 1990 there are no limitations to residency registration anymore .

they were descended from norse -lrb- `` norman '' comes from `` norseman '' -rrb- raiders and pirates from denmark , iceland and norway who , under their leader rollo , agreed to swear fealty to king charles iii of west francia . 
the distinct cultural and ethnic identity of the normans emerged initially in the first half of the 10th century , and it continued to evolve over the succeeding centuries . 
norman adventurers founded the kingdom of sicily under roger ii after conquering southern italy on the saracens and byzantines , and an expedition on behalf of their duke , william the conqueror , led to the norman conquest of england at the battle of hastings in 1066 . 
the duchy of normandy , which they formed by treaty with the french crown , was a great fief of medieval france , and under richard i of normandy was forged into a cohesive and formidable principality in feudal tenure . 
the normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually for their christian piety , becoming exponents of the catholic orthodoxy into which they assimilated . 
the english name `` normans '' comes from the french words normans/normanz , plural of normant , modern french normand , which is itself borrowed from old low franconian nortmann `` northman '' or directly from old norse norðmaðr , latinized variously as nortmannus , normannus , or nordmannus -lrb- recorded in medieval latin , 9th century -rrb- to mean `` norseman , viking '' .

the duchy of normandy , which began in 911 as a fiefdom , was established by the treaty of saint-clair-sur-epte between king charles iii of west francia and the famed viking ruler rollo , and was situated in the former frankish kingdom of neustria .

the area corresponded to the northern part of present-day upper normandy down to the river seine , but the duchy would eventually extend west beyond the seine . 
before rollo 's arrival , its populations did not differ from picardy or the île-de-france , which were considered `` frankish '' . 
the descendants of rollo 's vikings and their frankish wives would replace the norse religion and old norse language with catholicism -lrb- christianity -rrb- and the gallo-romance language of the local people , blending their maternal frankish heritage with old norse traditions and customs to synthesize a unique `` norman '' culture in the north of france .

most norman knights remained poor and land-hungry , and by 1066 normandy had been exporting fighting horsemen for more than a generation . 
in 999 , according to amatus of montecassino , norman pilgrims returning from jerusalem called in at the port of salerno when a saracen attack occurred . 
william of apulia tells that , in 1016 , norman pilgrims to the shrine of the archangel michael at monte gargano were met by melus of bari , a lombard nobleman and rebel , who persuaded them to return with more warriors to help throw off the byzantine rule , which they did .

the drengot family thereafter attained the principality of capua , and emperor henry iii legally ennobled the hauteville leader , drogo , as `` dux et magister italiae comesque normannorum totius apuliae et calabriae '' -lrb- `` duke and master of italy and count of the normans of all apulia and calabria '' -rrb- in 1047 . 
he promptly awarded their elected leader , william iron arm , with the title of count in his capital of melfi . 
from these bases , the normans eventually captured sicily and malta from the saracens , under the leadership of the famous robert guiscard , a hauteville , and his younger brother roger the great count . 
roger 's son , roger ii of sicily , was crowned king in 1130 -lrb- exactly one century after rainulf was `` crowned '' count -rrb- by antipope anacletus ii . 
the normans left their legacy in many castles , such as william iron arm 's citadel at squillace , and cathedrals , such as roger ii 's cappella palatina chapel at palermo , which dot the landscape and give a wholly distinct architectural flavor to accompany its unique history . 
one of the great geographical treatises of the middle ages , the `` tabula rogeriana '' , was written by the andalusian al-idrisi for king roger ii of sicily , and entitled `` kitab rudjdjar '' -lrb- `` the book of roger '' -rrb- .

under this state , there was great religious freedom , and alongside the norman nobles existed a meritocratic bureaucracy of jews , muslims and christians , both catholic and eastern orthodox . 
soon after the normans began to enter italy , they entered the byzantine empire and then armenia , fighting against the pechenegs , the bulgars , and especially the seljuk turks . 
one of the first norman mercenaries to serve as a byzantine general was hervé in the 1050s . 
in the 1060s , robert crispin led the normans of edessa against the turks . 
roussel de bailleul even tried to carve out an independent state in asia minor with support from the local population , but he was stopped by the byzantine general alexius komnenos . 
they even lent their ethnicity to the name of their castle : afranji , meaning `` franks . '' 
a norman named oursel led a force of `` franks '' into the upper euphrates valley in northern syria . 
some normans joined turkish forces to aid in the destruction of the armenians vassal-states of sassoun and taron in far eastern anatolia . 
several families of byzantine greece were of norman mercenary origin during the period of the comnenian restoration , when byzantine emperors were seeking out western european warriors . 
robert guiscard , an other norman adventurer previously elevated to the dignity of count of apulia as the result of his military successes , ultimately drove the byzantines out of southern italy . 
the city 's garrison resisted until february 1082 , when dyrrachium was betrayed to the normans by the venetian and amalfitan merchants who had settled there . 
after allying himself with croatia and the catholic cities of dalmatia , in 1081 he led an army of 30,000 men in 300 ships landing on the southern shores of albania , capturing valona , kanina , jericho -lrb- orikumi -rrb- , and reaching butrint after numerous pillages . 
meanwhile , they occupied petrela , the citadel of mili at the banks of the river deabolis , gllavenica -lrb- ballsh -rrb- , kanina and jericho . 
a few years after the first crusade , in 1107 , the normans under the command of bohemond , robert 's son , landed in valona and besieged dyrrachium using the most sophisticated military equipment of the time , but to no avail .

the further decline of byzantine state-of-affairs paved the road to a third attack in 1185 , when a large norman army invaded dyrrachium , owing to the betrayal of high byzantine officials .

some time later , dyrrachium -- one of the most important naval bases of the adriatic -- fell again to byzantine hands . 
this relationship eventually produced closer ties of blood through the marriage of emma , sister of duke richard ii of normandy , and king ethelred ii of england .

the invading normans and their descendants replaced the anglo-saxons as the ruling class of england . 
it in turn evolved into modern english . 
the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in 1169 . 
the normans settled mostly in an area in the east of ireland , later known as the pale , and also built many fine castles and settlements , including trim castle and dublin castle . 
the normans had a profound effect on irish culture and history after their invasion at bannow bay in 1169 . 
one of the claimants of the english throne opposing william the conqueror , edgar atheling , eventually fled to scotland . 
king malcolm iii of scotland married edgar 's sister margaret , and came into opposition to william who had already disputed scotland 's southern borders . 
william invaded scotland in 1072 , riding as far as abernethy where he met up with his fleet of ships . 
malcolm submitted , paid homage to william and surrendered his son duncan as a hostage , beginning a series of arguments as to whether the scottish crown owed allegiance to the king of england . 
king david i of scotland , whose elder brother alexander i had married sybilla of normandy , was instrumental in introducing normans and norman culture to scotland , part of the process some scholars call the `` davidian revolution '' .

these normans began a long period of slow conquest during which almost all of wales was at some point subject to norman interference . 
in 1018 , roger de tosny travelled to the iberian peninsula to carve out a state for himself from moorish lands , but failed . 
in 1064 , during the war of barbastro , william of montreuil led the papal army and took a huge booty . 
after the successful siege of antioch in 1097 , bohemond began carving out an independent principality around that city . 
in 1096 , crusaders passing by the siege of amalfi were joined by bohemond of taranto and his nephew tancred with an army of italo-normans . 
tancred was instrumental in the conquest of jerusalem and he worked for the expansion of the crusader kingdom in transjordan and the region of galilee . 
the conquest of cyprus by the anglo-norman forces of the third crusade opened a new chapter in the history of the island , which would be under western european domination for the following 380 years . 
but a storm dispersed the fleet . 
after some searching , it was discovered that the boat carrying his sister and his fiancée berengaria was anchored on the south coast of cyprus , together with the wrecks of several other ships , including the treasure ship . 
in april 1191 richard the lion-hearted left messina with a large fleet in order to reach acre . 
survivors of the wrecks had been taken prisoner by the island 's despot isaac komnenos . 
all declared their support for richard provided that he support guy against his rival conrad of montferrat . 
isaac surrendered and was confined with silver chains , because richard had promised that he would not place him in irons . 
various princes of the holy land arrived in limassol at the same time , in particular guy de lusignan . 
while in limassol , richard the lion-heart married berengaria of navarre , first-born daughter of king sancho vi of navarre . 
the wedding was held on 12 may 1191 at the chapel of st. george and it was attended by richard 's sister joan , whom he had brought from sicily . 
among other grand ceremonies was a double coronation : richard caused himself to be crowned king of cyprus , and berengaria queen of england and queen of cyprus as well . 
it was only in 1489 that the venetians acquired full control of the island , which remained a christian stronghold until the fall of famagusta in 1571 . 
shortly after the conquest , cyprus was sold to the knights templar and it was subsequently acquired , in 1192 , by guy de lusignan and became a stable feudal kingdom . 
between 1402 and 1405 , the expedition led by the norman noble jean de bethencourt and the poitevine gadifer de la salle conquered the canarian islands of lanzarote , fuerteventura and el hierro off the atlantic coast of africa . 
bethencourt took the title of king of the canary islands , as vassal to henry iii of castile . 
in 1418 , jean 's nephew maciot de bethencourt sold the rights to the islands to enrique pérez de guzmán , 2nd count de niebla .

the customary law of normandy was developed between the 10th and 13th centuries and survives today through the legal systems of jersey and guernsey in the channel islands . 
norman customary law was transcribed in two customaries in latin by two judges for use by them and their colleagues : these are the très ancien coutumier -lrb- very ancient customary -rrb- , authored between 1200 and 1245 ; and the grand coutumier de normandie -lrb- great customary of normandy , originally summa de legibus normanniae in curia laïcali -rrb- , authored between 1235 and 1245 . 
they spread a unique romanesque idiom to england and italy , and the encastellation of these regions with keeps in their north french style fundamentally altered the military landscape . 
their style was characterised by rounded arches , particularly over windows and doorways , and massive proportions . 
in england , the period of norman architecture immediately succeeds that of the anglo-saxon and precedes the early gothic .

in southern italy , the normans incorporated elements of islamic , lombard , and byzantine building techniques into their own , initiating a unique style known as norman-arab architecture within the kingdom of sicily . 
however , in the early 11th century the dukes began a programme of church reform , encouraging the cluniac reform of monasteries and patronising intellectual pursuits , especially the proliferation of scriptoria and the reconstitution of a compilation of lost illuminated manuscripts .

the french wars of religion in the 16th century and french revolution in the 18th successively destroyed much of what existed in the way of the architectural and artistic remnant of this norman creativity . 
by far the most famous work of norman art is the bayeux tapestry , which is not a tapestry but a work of embroidery .

it was commissioned by odo , the bishop of bayeux and first earl of kent , employing natives from kent who were learned in the nordic traditions imported in the previous half century by the danish vikings . 
many churches preserve sculptured fonts , capitals , and more importantly mosaics , which were common in norman italy and drew heavily on the greek heritage . 
normandy was the site of several important developments in the history of classical music in the 11th century . 
at fécamp , under two italian abbots , william of volpiano and john of ravenna , the system of denoting notes by letters was developed and taught . 
under the norman abbot robert de grantmesnil , several monks of saint-evroul fled to southern italy , where they were patronised by robert guiscard and established a latin monastery at sant ` eufemia .

tesla 's demonstration of his induction motor and westinghouse 's subsequent licensing of the patent , both in 1888 , put tesla firmly on the `` ac '' side of the so-called `` war of currents , '' an electrical distribution battle being waged between thomas edison and george westinghouse that had been simmering since westinghouse 's first ac system in 1886 and had reached the point of all-out warfare by 1888 . 
this started out as a competition between rival lighting systems with edison holding all the patents for dc and the incandescent light and westinghouse using his own patented ac system to power arc lights as well as incandescent lamps of a slightly different design to get around the edison patent . 
the competition resulted in edison machine works pursuing ac development in 1890 and by 1892 thomas edison was no longer in control of his own company , which was consolidated into the conglomerate general electric and converting to an ac delivery system at that point .

the acquisition of a feasible ac motor gave westinghouse a key patent in building a completely integrated ac system , but the financial strain of buying up patents and hiring the engineers needed to build it meant development of tesla 's motor had to be put on hold for a while .

although a patent-sharing agreement was signed between the two companies in 1896 westinghouse was still cash-strapped from the financial warfare . 
westinghouse convinced tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over tesla 's ac patents in exchange for westinghouse electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $ 216,000 ; this provided westinghouse a break from what , due to alternating current 's rapid gain in popularity , had turned out to be an overly generous $ 2.50 per ac horsepower royalty .

tesla held that , with his circuits , the `` instrument will ... enable one to generate roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus . '' 
tesla incorrectly believed that x-rays were longitudinal waves , such as those produced in waves in plasmas .

`` tesla said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body , and again at the place where it passed out . '' 
in comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his `` electric gun , '' tesla said , `` the particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles ... and they will travel in concentrations . '' 
tesla 's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far as lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in st. louis , missouri , the franklin institute in philadelphia , pennsylvania , and the national electric light association . 
many devices such as the tesla coil were used in the further development of radio .

on 17 may 1899 , tesla moved to colorado springs , where he would have room for his high-voltage , high-frequency experiments ; his lab was located near foote ave. and kiowa st. he chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it . 
upon his arrival , he told reporters that he was conducting wireless telegraphy experiments , transmitting signals from pikes peak to paris . 
on 15 june 1899 , tesla performed his first experiments at his colorado springs lab ; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long , but very thick and noisy .

tesla investigated atmospheric electricity , observing lightning signals via his receivers . 
he stated that he observed stationary waves during this time . 
the great distances and the nature of what tesla was detecting from lightning storms confirmed his belief that the earth had a resonant frequency . 
he produced artificial lightning , with discharges consisting of millions of volts and up to 135 feet long .

thunder from the released energy was heard 15 miles away in cripple creek , colorado . 
light bulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off . 
butterflies were electrified , swirling in circles with blue halos of st. elmo 's fire around their wings . 
while experimenting , tesla inadvertently faulted a power station generator , causing a power outage . 
in august 1917 , tesla explained what had happened in the electrical experimenter : `` as an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated , it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out , due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them , and which caused heavy sparks to jump through the windings and destroy the insulation !

during his time at his lab , tesla observed unusual signals from his receiver which he concluded may be communications from another planet . 
reporters treated it as a sensational story and jumped to the conclusion tesla was hearing signals from mars . 
he expanded on the signals he heard in a 9 february 1901 collier 's weekly article `` talking with planets '' where he said it had not been immediately apparent to him that he was hearing `` intelligently controlled signals '' and that the signals could come from mars , venus , or other planets . 
it has been hypothesized that he may have intercepted marconi 's european experiments in july 1899 -- marconi may have transmitted the letter s -lrb- dot/dot/dot -rrb- in a naval demonstration , the same three impulses that tesla hinted at hearing in colorado -- or signals from another experimenter in wireless transmission .

tesla later approached morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter . 
when asked where all the money had gone , tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the panic of 1901 , which he -lrb- morgan -rrb- had caused . 
morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by tesla 's breach of contract by asking for more funds . 
over the next five years , tesla wrote over 50 letters to morgan , pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of wardenclyffe .

tesla invented a steam-powered mechanical oscillator -- tesla 's oscillator . 
while experimenting with mechanical oscillators at his houston street lab , tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings . 
as the speed grew , it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and , belatedly realizing the danger , he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment , just as the police arrived. :162 -- 164 in february 1912 , an article -- `` nikola tesla , dreamer '' by allan l. benson -- was published in world today , in which an artist 's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption , `` tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth 's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization .

tesla theorized that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence . 
in 1912 , he crafted `` a plan to make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity , '' wiring the walls of a schoolroom and , `` saturating -lsb- the schoolroom -rsb- with infinitesimal electric waves vibrating at high frequency . 
the plan was , at least provisionally approved by then superintendent of new york city schools , william h. maxwell .

computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty , and relating those classes to each other . 
a problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources , whatever the algorithm used . 
the theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage . 
the theory formalizes this intuition , by introducing mathematical models of computation to study these problems and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve them , such as time and storage . 
other complexity measures are also used , such as the amount of communication -lrb- used in communication complexity -rrb- , the number of gates in a circuit -lrb- used in circuit complexity -rrb- and the number of processors -lrb- used in parallel computing -rrb- . 
one of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and can not do . 
closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory . 
closely related fields in theoretical computer science are analysis of algorithms and computability theory . 
a key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem , whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem .

the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself . 
the input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance , and should not be confused with the problem itself . 
in contrast , an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance , which can serve as the input for a decision problem . 
a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance . 
a computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of instances together with a solution for every instance . 
to further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance , consider the following instance of the decision version of the traveling salesman problem : is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of germany 's 15 largest cities ? 
the quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem , such as asking for a round trip through all sites in milan whose total length is at most 10 km . 
for this reason , complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances . 
when considering computational problems , a problem instance is a string over an alphabet . 
usually , the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet -lrb- i.e. , the set -lcb- 0,1 -rcb- -rrb- , and thus the strings are bitstrings .

the input is an arbitrary graph . 
the formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs -- of course , to obtain a precise definition of this language , one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings .

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output -lrb- of a total function -rrb- is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no .

a function problem is a computational problem where a single output -lrb- of a total function -rrb- is expected for every input , but the output is more complex than that of a decision problem , that is , it is n't just yes or no . 
it is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems . 
for example , the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples -lrb- a , b , c -rrb- such that the relation a × b = c holds . 
to measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem , one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem . 
however , the running time may , in general , depend on the instance . 
thus the time required to solve a problem -lrb- or the space required , or any measure of complexity -rrb- is calculated as a function of the size of the instance . 
this is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits . 
complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size . 
cobham 's thesis says that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm . 
if the input size is n , the time taken can be expressed as a function of n . 
since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst-case time complexity t -lrb- n -rrb- is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n . 
since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst-case time complexity t -lrb- n -rrb- is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n . 
if t -lrb- n -rrb- is a polynomial in n , then the algorithm is said to be a polynomial time algorithm . 
a turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine . 
it is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm , there exists a turing machine that solves the problem . 
since turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically , and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation , the turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory . 
it is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape . 
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions . 
a deterministic turing machine is the most basic turing machine , which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions . 
a probabilistic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an extra supply of random bits . 
a non-deterministic turing machine is a deterministic turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism , which allows a turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state . 
algorithms that use random bits are called randomized algorithms . 
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non-deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines . 
they are all equally powerful in principle , but when resources -lrb- such as time or space -rrb- are bounded , some of these may be more powerful than others . 
many types of turing machines are used to define complexity classes , such as deterministic turing machines , probabilistic turing machines , non-deterministic turing machines , quantum turing machines , symmetric turing machines and alternating turing machines . 
many machine models different from the standard multi-tape turing machines have been proposed in the literature , for example random access machines . 
perhaps surprisingly , each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power . 
the time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary . 
what all these models have in common is that the machines operate deterministically . 
for example , a non-deterministic turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once . 
however , some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources . 
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems . 
the non-deterministic turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms , but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze , so that non-deterministic time is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems . 
the time required by a deterministic turing machine m on input x is the total number of state transitions , or steps , the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer -lrb- `` yes '' or `` no '' -rrb- . 
since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty , one defines sets of problems based on some criteria . 
for instance , the set of problems solvable within time f -lrb- n -rrb- on a deterministic turing machine is then denoted by dtime -lrb- f -lrb- n -rrb- -rrb- . 
for a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space , a computational model such as the deterministic turing machine is used . 
although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources , any complexity measure can be viewed as a computational resource .

the worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order , and the algorithm takes time o -lrb- n2 -rrb- for this case . 
to classify the computation time -lrb- or similar resources , such as space consumption -rrb- , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem . 
analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of analysis of algorithms . 
to classify the computation time -lrb- or similar resources , such as space consumption -rrb- , one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the minimum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem . 
to show an upper bound t -lrb- n -rrb- on the time complexity of a problem , one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most t -lrb- n -rrb- . 
however , proving lower bounds is much more difficult , since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem . 
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms . 
upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the big o notation , which hides constant factors and smaller terms . 
for instance , if t -lrb- n -rrb- = 7n2 + 15n + 40 , in big o notation one would write t -lrb- n -rrb- = o -lrb- n2 -rrb- . 
this makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used . 
of course , some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework .

of course , some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework . 
but bounding the computation time above by some concrete function f -lrb- n -rrb- often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model . 
for instance , the language -lcb- xx | x is any binary string -rcb- can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape turing machines . 
for instance , the language -lcb- xx | x is any binary string -rcb- can be solved in linear time on a multi-tape turing machine , but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape turing machines . 
if we allow polynomial variations in running time , cobham-edmonds thesis states that `` the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related '' -lrb- goldreich 2008 , chapter 1.2 -rrb- . 
this forms the basis for the complexity class p , which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic turing machine within polynomial time . 
many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm .

# p is an important complexity class of counting problems -lrb- not decision problems -rrb- . 
classes like ip and am are defined using interactive proof systems . 
for the complexity classes defined in this way , it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on -lrb- say -rrb- computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems . 
in particular , although dtime -lrb- n -rrb- is contained in dtime -lrb- n2 -rrb- , it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict . 
for time and space requirements , the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively . 
they are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources . 
having deduced such proper set inclusions , we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved . 
the time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes . 
for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace . 
for instance , the time hierarchy theorem tells us that p is strictly contained in exptime , and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that l is strictly contained in pspace . 
many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction . 
a reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem . 
for instance , if a problem x can be solved using an algorithm for y , x is no more difficult than y , and we say that x reduces to y . 
there are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , such as cook reductions , karp reductions and levin reductions , and the bound on the complexity of reductions , such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions . 
there are many different types of reductions , based on the method of reduction , such as cook reductions , karp reductions and levin reductions , and the bound on the complexity of reductions , such as polynomial-time reductions or log-space reductions . 
the most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction . 
for example , the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers . 
this means that the reduction process takes polynomial time . 
indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm . 
indeed , this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm . 
a problem x is hard for a class of problems c if every problem in c can be reduced to x. thus no problem in c is harder than x , since an algorithm for x allows us to solve any problem in c. of course , the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used .

in particular , the set of problems that are hard for np is the set of np-hard problems . 
this means that x is the hardest problem in c. -lrb- since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that x is one of the hardest problems in c. -rrb- thus the class of np-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in np , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in p. because the problem p = np is not solved , being able to reduce a known np-complete problem , π2 , to another problem , π1 , would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for π1 .

the complexity class p is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm . 
this hypothesis is called the cobham -- edmonds thesis . 
the complexity class np , on the other hand , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the boolean satisfiability problem , the hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem . 
the complexity class np , on the other hand , contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently , but for which no efficient algorithm is known , such as the boolean satisfiability problem , the hamiltonian path problem and the vertex cover problem . 
since deterministic turing machines are special non-deterministic turing machines , it is easily observed that each problem in p is also member of the class np . 
if the answer is yes , many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions . 
these include various types of integer programming problems in operations research , many problems in logistics , protein structure prediction in biology , and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems . 
there is a us$ 1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem . 
it was shown by ladner that if p ≠ np then there exist problems in np that are neither in p nor np-complete . 
such problems are called np-intermediate problems . 
the graph isomorphism problem , the discrete logarithm problem and the integer factorization problem are examples of problems believed to be np-intermediate . 
the graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic . 
an important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in p , np-complete , or np-intermediate . 
if graph isomorphism is np-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level . 
if graph isomorphism is np-complete , the polynomial time hierarchy collapses to its second level . 
the best algorithm for this problem , due to laszlo babai and eugene luks has run time 2o -lrb- √ -lrb- n log -lrb- n -rrb- -rrb- -rrb- for graphs with n vertices . 
the integer factorization problem is the computational problem of determining the prime factorization of a given integer . 
phrased as a decision problem , it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a factor less than k. no efficient integer factorization algorithm is known , and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems , such as the rsa algorithm .

the best known algorithm for integer factorization is the general number field sieve , which takes time o -lrb- e -lrb- 64/9 -rrb- 1/3 -lrb- n.log 2 -rrb- 1/3 -lrb- log -lrb- n.log 2 -rrb- -rrb- 2/3 -rrb- to factor an n-bit integer . 
many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal , but this has not been proved . 
for instance p ⊆ np ⊆ pp ⊆ pspace , but it is possible that p = pspace . 
since there are many known complexity classes between p and pspace , such as rp , bpp , pp , bqp , ma , ph , etc. , it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class . 
proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory . 
along the same lines , co-np is the class containing the complement problems -lrb- i.e. problems with the yes/no answers reversed -rrb- of np problems . 
along the same lines , co-np is the class containing the complement problems -lrb- i.e. problems with the yes/no answers reversed -rrb- of np problems . 
it is believed that np is not equal to co-np ; however , it has not yet been proven . 
it has been shown that if these two complexity classes are not equal then p is not equal to np . 
similarly , it is not known if l -lrb- the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space -rrb- is strictly contained in p or equal to p. again , there are many complexity classes between the two , such as nl and nc , and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes .

problems that can be solved in theory -lrb- e.g. , given large but finite time -rrb- , but which in practice take too long for their solutions to be useful , are known as intractable problems . 
to see why exponential-time algorithms might be unusable in practice , consider a program that makes 2n operations before halting . 
if np is not the same as p , then the np-complete problems are also intractable in this sense . 
for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases . 
for example , the decision problem in presburger arithmetic has been shown not to be in p , yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases . 
similarly , algorithms can solve the np-complete knapsack problem over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and sat solvers routinely handle large instances of the np-complete boolean satisfiability problem .

before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off , numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers . 
most influential among these was the definition of turing machines by alan turing in 1936 , which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer .

in education , teachers facilitate student learning , often in a school or academy or perhaps in another environment such as outdoors . 
the objective is typically accomplished through either an informal or formal approach to learning , including a course of study and lesson plan that teaches skills , knowledge and/or thinking skills . 
different ways to teach are often referred to as pedagogy . 
many times , teachers assist in learning outside of the classroom by accompanying students on field trips . 
the increasing use of technology , specifically the rise of the internet over the past decade , has begun to shape the way teachers approach their roles in the classroom .

teaching using pedagogy also involve assessing the educational levels of the students on particular skills . 
for example , an experienced teacher and parent described the place of a teacher in learning as follows : `` the real bulk of learning takes place in self-study and problem solving with a lot of feedback around that loop . 
the function of the teacher is to pressure the lazy , inspire the bored , deflate the cocky , encourage the timid , detect and correct individual flaws , and broaden the viewpoint of all .

this function looks like that of a coach using the whole gamut of psychology to get each new class of rookies off the bench and into the game . '' 
perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children . 
in primary schools each class has a teacher who stays with them for most of the week and will teach them the whole curriculum . 
in secondary schools they will be taught by different subject specialists each session during the week and may have ten or more different teachers . 
perhaps the most significant difference between primary school and secondary school teaching is the relationship between teachers and children . 
the relationship between children and their teachers tends to be closer in the primary school where they act as form tutor , specialist teacher and surrogate parent during the course of the day . 
however , alternative approaches for primary education do exist . 
one of these , sometimes referred to as a `` platoon '' system , involves placing a group of students together in one class that moves from one specialist to another for every subject . 
students still derive a strong sense of security by staying with the same group of peers for all classes . 
the advantage here is that students learn from teachers who specialize in one subject and who tend to be more knowledgeable in that one area than a teacher who teaches many subjects . 
this is true throughout most of the united states as well . 
co-teaching has also become a new trend amongst educational institutions . 
co-teaching is defined as two or more teachers working harmoniously to fulfill the needs of every student in the classroom . 
co-teaching focuses the student on learning by providing a social networking support that allows them to reach their full cognitive potential .

whilst this is the consensus viewpoint amongst the majority of academics , some teachers and parents advocate a more assertive and confrontational style of discipline . 
this viewpoint is supported by the educational attainment of countries -- in east asia for instance -- that combine strict discipline with high standards of education . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- such individuals claim that many problems with modern schooling stem from the weakness in school discipline and if teachers exercised firm control over the classroom they would be able to teach more efficiently .

sudbury model democratic schools claim that popularly based authority can maintain order more effectively than dictatorial authority for governments and schools alike . 
primarily because rules and regulations are made by the community as a whole , thence the school atmosphere is one of persuasion and negotiation , rather than confrontation since there is no one to confront . 
they also claim that in these schools the preservation of public order is easier and more efficient than anywhere else . 
sudbury model democratic schools ' proponents argue that a school that has good , clear laws , fairly and democratically passed by the entire school community , and a good judicial system for enforcing these laws , is a school in which community discipline prevails , and in which an increasingly sophisticated concept of law and order develops , against other schools today , where rules are arbitrary , authority is absolute , punishment is capricious , and due process of law is unknown . 
since teachers can affect how students perceive the course materials , it has been found that teachers who showed enthusiasm towards the course materials and students can affect a positive learning experience towards the course materials . 
on teacher/course evaluations , it was found that teachers who have a positive disposition towards the course content tend to transfer their passion to receptive students . 
these teachers do not teach by rote but attempt to find new invigoration for the course materials on a daily basis . 
students who had enthusiastic teachers tend to rate them higher than teachers who did n't show much enthusiasm for the course materials . 
recent research has found a correlation between teacher enthusiasm and students ' intrinsic motivation to learn and vitality in the classroom . 
students who experienced a very enthusiastic teacher were more likely to read lecture material outside of the classroom . 
controlled , experimental studies exploring intrinsic motivation of college students has shown that nonverbal expressions of enthusiasm , such as demonstrative gesturing , dramatic movements which are varied , and emotional facial expressions , result in college students reporting higher levels of intrinsic motivation to learn .

enthusiastic teachers may also lead to students becoming more self-determined in their own learning process . 
there are various mechanisms by which teacher enthusiasm may facilitate higher levels of intrinsic motivation . 
finally , the concept of emotional contagion , may also apply . 
teacher enthusiasm may contribute to a classroom atmosphere full of energy and enthusiasm which feed student interest and excitement in learning the subject matter . 
research shows that student motivation and attitudes towards school are closely linked to student-teacher relationships . 
enthusiastic teachers are particularly good at creating beneficial relations with their students . 
here , personal success is a student 's internal goal of improving himself , whereas academic success includes the goals he receives from his superior . 
a teacher must guide his student in aligning his personal goals with his academic goals .

the three most important aspects of teacher enthusiasm are enthusiasm about teaching , enthusiasm about the students , and enthusiasm about the subject matter . 
the teacher also needs to be enthusiastic about the subject matter they are teaching . 
a spark in the teacher may create a spark of excitement in the student as well . 
an enthusiastic teacher has the ability to be very influential in the young students life . 
the way a teacher promotes the course they are teaching , the more the student will get out of the subject matter . 
misconduct by teachers , especially sexual misconduct , has been getting increased scrutiny from the media and the courts .

his refusal to retract all of his writings at the demand of pope leo x in 1520 and the holy roman emperor charles v at the diet of worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the emperor . 
luther taught that salvation and subsequently eternal life is not earned by good deeds but is received only as a free gift of god 's grace through faith in jesus christ as redeemer from sin .

in accordance with his father 's wishes , luther enrolled in law school at the same university that year but dropped out almost immediately , believing that law represented uncertainty . 
luther sought assurances about life and was drawn to theology and philosophy , expressing particular interest in aristotle , william of ockham , and gabriel biel . 
he was deeply influenced by two tutors , bartholomaeus arnoldi von usingen and jodocus trutfetter , who taught him to be suspicious of even the greatest thinkers and to test everything himself by experience . 
for luther , reason could be used to question men and institutions , but not god . 
later telling his father he was terrified of death and divine judgment , he cried out , `` help ! 
he later attributed his decision to an event : on 2 july 1505 , he was returning to university on horseback after a trip home . 
he left law school , sold his books , and entered a closed augustinian cloister in erfurt on 17 july 1505 . 
one friend blamed the decision on luther 's sadness over the deaths of two friends . 
his father was furious over what he saw as a waste of luther 's education . 
luther dedicated himself to the augustinian order , devoting himself to fasting , long hours in prayer , pilgrimage , and frequent confession . 
luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair . 
he said , `` i lost touch with christ the savior and comforter , and made of him the jailer and hangman of my poor soul . '' 
johann von staupitz , his superior , pointed luther 's mind away from continual reflection upon his sins toward the merits of christ . 
he taught that true repentance does not involve self-inflicted penances and punishments but rather a change of heart .

on 31 october 1517 , luther wrote to his bishop , albert of mainz , protesting the sale of indulgences . 
he enclosed in his letter a copy of his `` disputation of martin luther on the power and efficacy of indulgences '' , which came to be known as the ninety-five theses . 
hans hillerbrand writes that luther had no intention of confronting the church , but saw his disputation as a scholarly objection to church practices , and the tone of the writing is accordingly `` searching , rather than doctrinaire . '' 
hillerbrand writes that there is nevertheless an undercurrent of challenge in several of the theses , particularly in thesis 86 , which asks : `` why does the pope , whose wealth today is greater than the wealth of the richest crassus , build the basilica of st. peter with the money of poor believers rather than with his own money ?

luther 's writings circulated widely , reaching france , england , and italy as early as 1519 . 
students thronged to wittenberg to hear luther speak . 
this early part of luther 's career was one of his most creative and productive . 
three of his best-known works were published in 1520 : to the christian nobility of the german nation , on the babylonian captivity of the church , and on the freedom of a christian .

from 1510 to 1520 , luther lectured on the psalms , the books of hebrews , romans , and galatians . 
as he studied these portions of the bible , he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the catholic church in new ways . 
he became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of christianity . 
he became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of christianity . 
the most important for luther was the doctrine of justification -- god 's act of declaring a sinner righteous -- by faith alone through god 's grace . 
luther came to understand justification as entirely the work of god . 
this teaching by luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication on the bondage of the will , which was written in response to on free will by desiderius erasmus -lrb- 1524 -rrb- . 
faith , for luther , was a gift from god ; the experience of being justified by faith was `` as though i had been born again . '' 
he explained his concept of `` justification '' in the smalcald articles : 
his entry into paradise , no less , was a discovery about `` the righteousness of god '' -- a discovery that `` the just person '' of whom the bible speaks -lrb- as in romans 1:17 -rrb- lives by faith .

archbishop albrecht of mainz and magdeburg did not reply to luther 's letter containing the 95 theses . 
he had the theses checked for heresy and in december 1517 forwarded them to rome . 
he needed the revenue from the indulgences to pay off a papal dispensation for his tenure of more than one bishopric . 
as luther later noted , `` the pope had a finger in the pie as well , because one half was to go to the building of st peter 's church in rome '' . 
he had the theses checked for heresy and in december 1517 forwarded them to rome . 
pope leo x was used to reformers and heretics , and he responded slowly , `` with great care as is proper . '' 
over the next three years he deployed a series of papal theologians and envoys against luther , which served only to harden the reformer 's anti-papal theology . 
there , in october 1518 , under questioning by papal legate cardinal cajetan luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical church because historistical interpretation of bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the antichrist . 
there , in october 1518 , under questioning by papal legate cardinal cajetan luther stated that he did not consider the papacy part of the biblical church because historistical interpretation of bible prophecy concluded that the papacy was the antichrist . 
cajetan 's original instructions had been to arrest luther if he failed to recant , but the legate desisted from doing so . 
in january 1519 , at altenburg in saxony , the papal nuncio karl von miltitz adopted a more conciliatory approach . 
luther made certain concessions to the saxon , who was a relative of the elector , and promised to remain silent if his opponents did . 
the theologian johann eck , however , was determined to expose luther 's doctrine in a public forum . 
luther 's boldest assertion in the debate was that matthew 16:18 does not confer on popes the exclusive right to interpret scripture , and that therefore neither popes nor church councils were infallible . 
for this , eck branded luther a new jan hus , referring to the czech reformer and heretic burned at the stake in 1415 . 
on 15 june 1520 , the pope warned luther with the papal bull -lrb- edict -rrb- exsurge domine that he risked excommunication unless he recanted 41 sentences drawn from his writings , including the 95 theses , within 60 days .

karl von miltitz , a papal nuncio , attempted to broker a solution , but luther , who had sent the pope a copy of on the freedom of a christian in october , publicly set fire to the bull and decretals at wittenberg on 10 december 1520 , an act he defended in why the pope and his recent book are burned and assertions concerning all articles . 
as a consequence , luther was excommunicated by pope leo x on 3 january 1521 , in the bull decet romanum pontificem . 
the enforcement of the ban on the 95 theses fell to the secular authorities . 
on 18 april 1521 , luther appeared as ordered before the diet of worms . 
this was a general assembly of the estates of the holy roman empire that took place in worms , a town on the rhine . 
it was conducted from 28 january to 25 may 1521 , with emperor charles v presiding . 
prince frederick iii , elector of saxony , obtained a safe conduct for luther to and from the meeting . 
johann eck , speaking on behalf of the empire as assistant of the archbishop of trier , presented luther with copies of his writings laid out on a table and asked him if the books were his , and whether he stood by their contents .

he prayed , consulted friends , and gave his response the next day : 
luther confirmed he was their author , but requested time to think about the answer to the second question .

however , mullett suggests that given his nature , `` we are free to believe that luther would tend to select the more dramatic form of words . '' 
over the next five days , private conferences were held to determine luther 's fate . 
the emperor presented the final draft of the edict of worms on 25 may 1521 , declaring luther an outlaw , banning his literature , and requiring his arrest : `` we want him to be apprehended and punished as a notorious heretic . ''

it permitted anyone to kill luther without legal consequence . 
luther 's disappearance during his return trip back to wittenberg was planned . 
they escorted luther to the security of the wartburg castle at eisenach . 
during his stay at wartburg , which he referred to as `` my patmos '' , luther translated the new testament from greek into german and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings .

these included a renewed attack on archbishop albrecht of mainz , whom he shamed into halting the sale of indulgences in his episcopates , and a `` refutation of the argument of latomus , '' in which he expounded the principle of justification to jacobus latomus , an orthodox theologian from louvain . 
in this work , one of his most emphatic statements on faith , he argued that every good work designed to attract god 's favor is a sin . 
all humans are sinners by nature , he explained , and god 's grace -lrb- which can not be earned -rrb- alone can make them just . 
on 1 august 1521 , luther wrote to melanchthon on the same theme : `` be a sinner , and let your sins be strong , but let your trust in christ be stronger , and rejoice in christ who is the victor over sin , death , and the world .

we will commit sins while we are here , for this life is not a place where justice resides . '' 
in the summer of 1521 , luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of church practices . 
in on the abrogation of the private mass , he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice , asserting instead that it is a gift , to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation .

his essay on confession , whether the pope has the power to require it rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution , since `` every christian is a confessor . '' 
he assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin , because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation . 
in 1521 luther dealt largely with prophecy , in which he broadened the foundations of the reformation placing them on prophetic faith .

the reforms provoked disturbances , including a revolt by the augustinian friars against their prior , the smashing of statues and images in churches , and denunciations of the magistracy . 
wittenberg became even more volatile after christmas when a band of visionary zealots , the so-called zwickau prophets , arrived , preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the equality of man , adult baptism , and christ 's imminent return . 
when the town council asked luther to return , he decided it was his duty to act . 
luther secretly returned to wittenberg on 6 march 1522 . 
he wrote to the elector : `` during my absence , satan has entered my sheepfold , and committed ravages which i can not repair by writing , but only by my personal presence and living word . '' 
for eight days in lent , beginning on invocavit sunday , 9 march , luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the `` invocavit sermons '' . 
for eight days in lent , beginning on invocavit sunday , 9 march , luther preached eight sermons , which became known as the `` invocavit sermons '' . 
in these sermons , he hammered home the primacy of core christian values such as love , patience , charity , and freedom , and reminded the citizens to trust god 's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change . 
the effect of luther 's intervention was immediate . 
after the sixth sermon , the wittenberg jurist jerome schurf wrote to the elector : `` oh , what joy has dr. martin 's return spread among us !

luther sympathised with some of the peasants ' grievances , as he showed in his response to the twelve articles in may 1525 , but he reminded the aggrieved to obey the temporal authorities . 
during a tour of thuringia , he became enraged at the widespread burning of convents , monasteries , bishops ' palaces , and libraries . 
in against the murderous , thieving hordes of peasants , written on his return to wittenberg , he gave his interpretation of the gospel teaching on wealth , condemned the violence as the devil 's work , and called for the nobles to put down the rebels like mad dogs :

luther justified his opposition to the rebels on three grounds . 
first , in choosing violence over lawful submission to the secular government , they were ignoring christ 's counsel to `` render unto caesar the things that are caesar 's '' ; st. paul had written in his epistle to the romans 13:1 -- 7 that all authorities are appointed by god and therefore should not be resisted .

this reference from the bible forms the foundation for the doctrine known as the divine right of kings , or , in the german case , the divine right of the princes . 
second , the violent actions of rebelling , robbing , and plundering placed the peasants `` outside the law of god and empire '' , so they deserved `` death in body and soul , if only as highwaymen and murderers . '' 
without luther 's backing for the uprising , many rebels laid down their weapons ; others felt betrayed . 
their defeat by the swabian league at the battle of frankenhausen on 15 may 1525 , followed by müntzer 's execution , brought the revolutionary stage of the reformation to a close .

thereafter , radicalism found a refuge in the anabaptist movement and other religious movements , while luther 's reformation flourished under the wing of the secular powers .

his biblical ideal of congregations ' choosing their own ministers had proved unworkable . 
from 1525 to 1529 , he established a supervisory church body , laid down a new form of worship service , and wrote a clear summary of the new faith in the form of two catechisms .

luther 's thought is revolutionary to the extent that it is a theology of the cross , the negation of every affirmation : as long as the cross is at the center , the system building tendency of reason is held in check , and system building does not degenerate into system . 
to avoid confusing or upsetting the people , luther avoided extreme change . 
he concentrated on the church in the electorate of saxony , acting only as an adviser to churches in new territories , many of which followed his saxon model .

he worked closely with the new elector , john the steadfast , to whom he turned for secular leadership and funds on behalf of a church largely shorn of its assets and income after the break with rome . 
for luther 's biographer martin brecht , this partnership `` was the beginning of a questionable and originally unintended development towards a church government under the temporal sovereign '' . 
in response to demands for a german liturgy , luther wrote a german mass , which he published in early 1526 . 
he did not intend it as a replacement for his 1523 adaptation of the latin mass but as an alternative for the `` simple people '' , a `` public stimulation for people to believe and become christians . ''

luther based his order on the catholic service but omitted `` everything that smacks of sacrifice '' ; and the mass became a celebration where everyone received the wine as well as the bread . 
he retained the elevation of the host and chalice , while trappings such as the mass vestments , altar , and candles were made optional , allowing freedom of ceremony . 
luther and his colleagues introduced the new order of worship during their visitation of the electorate of saxony , which began in 1527 .

they also assessed the standard of pastoral care and christian education in the territory .

luther devised the catechism as a method of imparting the basics of christianity to the congregations . 
in 1529 , he wrote the large catechism , a manual for pastors and teachers , as well as a synopsis , the small catechism , to be memorised by the people themselves .

luther incorporated questions and answers in the catechism so that the basics of christian faith would not just be learned by rote , `` the way monkeys do it '' , but understood . 
the catechism is one of luther 's most personal works . 
`` regarding the plan to collect my writings in volumes , '' he wrote , `` i am quite cool and not at all eager about it because , roused by a saturnian hunger , i would rather see them all devoured . 
for i acknowledge none of them to be really a book of mine , except perhaps the bondage of the will and the catechism . '' 
the small catechism has earned a reputation as a model of clear religious teaching . 
it remains in use today , along with luther 's hymns and his translation of the bible . 
luther 's small catechism proved especially effective in helping parents teach their children ; likewise the larger catechism was effective for pastors .

using the german vernacular , they expressed the apostles ' creed in simpler , more personal , trinitarian language . 
that is , luther depicted the trinity not as a doctrine to be learned , but as persons to be known . 
salvation originates with the father and draws the believer to the father . 
luther had published his german translation of the new testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the old testament in 1534 , when the whole bible was published . 
luther had published his german translation of the new testament in 1522 , and he and his collaborators completed the translation of the old testament in 1534 , when the whole bible was published . 
he continued to work on refining the translation until the end of his life . 
when he was criticised for inserting the word `` alone '' after `` faith '' in romans 3:28 , he replied in part : '' -lsb- t -rsb- he text itself and the meaning of st. paul urgently require and demand it . 
... but when works are so completely cut away -- and that must mean that faith alone justifies -- whoever would speak plainly and clearly about this cutting away of works will have to say , ` faith alone justifies us , and not works ' . ''

published at a time of rising demand for german-language publications , luther 's version quickly became a popular and influential bible translation . 
as such , it made a significant contribution to the evolution of the german language and literature . 
furnished with notes and prefaces by luther , and with woodcuts by lucas cranach that contained anti-papal imagery , it played a major role in the spread of luther 's doctrine throughout germany . 
the luther bible influenced other vernacular translations , such as william tyndale 's english bible -lrb- 1525 forward -rrb- , a precursor of the king james bible . 
luther was a prolific hymn-writer , authoring hymns such as `` ein feste burg ist unser gott '' -lrb- `` a mighty fortress is our god '' -rrb- , based on psalm 46 , and `` vom himmel hoch , da komm ich her '' -lrb- `` from heaven above to earth i come '' -rrb- , based on luke 2:11 -- 12 . 
luther connected high art and folk music , also all classes , clergy and laity , men , women and children . 
his tool of choice for this connection was the singing of german hymns in connection with worship , school , home , and the public arena . 
he often accompanied the sung hymns with a lute , later recreated as the waldzither that became a national instrument of germany in the 20th century .

this behavior started with his learning of the execution of johann esch and heinrich voes , the first individuals to be martyred by the roman catholic church for lutheran views , prompting luther to write the hymn `` ein neues lied wir heben an '' -lrb- `` a new song we raise '' -rrb- , which is generally known in english by john c. messenger 's translation by the title and first line `` flung to the heedless winds '' and sung to the tune ibstone composed in 1875 by maria c. tiddeman .

luther 's 1524 creedal hymn `` wir glauben all an einen gott '' -lrb- `` we all believe in one true god '' -rrb- is a three-stanza confession of faith prefiguring luther 's 1529 three-part explanation of the apostles ' creed in the small catechism .

luther 's hymn , adapted and expanded from an earlier german creedal hymn , gained widespread use in vernacular lutheran liturgies as early as 1525 . 
sixteenth-century lutheran hymnals also included `` wir glauben all '' among the catechetical hymns , although 18th-century hymnals tended to label the hymn as trinitarian rather than catechetical , and 20th-century lutherans rarely use the hymn because of the perceived difficulty of its tune . 
luther 's 1538 hymnic version of the lord 's prayer , `` vater unser im himmelreich '' , corresponds exactly to luther 's explanation of the prayer in the small catechism , with one stanza for each of the seven prayer petitions , plus opening and closing stanzas .

the hymn functioned both as a liturgical setting of the lord 's prayer and as a means of examining candidates on specific catechism questions . 
the extant manuscript shows multiple revisions , demonstrating luther 's concern to clarify and strengthen the text and to provide an appropriately prayerful tune . 
other 16th - and 20th-century versifications of the lord 's prayer have adopted luther 's tune , although modern texts are considerably shorter . 
luther wrote `` aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir '' -lrb- `` from depths of woe i cry to you '' -rrb- in 1523 as a hymnic version of psalm 130 and sent it as a sample to encourage evangelical colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in german worship .

in a collaboration with paul speratus , this and seven other hymns were published in the achtliederbuch , the first lutheran hymnal . 
because it expressed essential reformation doctrine , this expanded version of `` aus tiefer not '' was designated as a regular component of several regional lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals , including luther 's own . 
`` nun komm , der heiden heiland '' -lrb- now come , savior of the gentiles -rrb- , based on veni redemptor gentium , became the main hymn -lrb- hauptlied -rrb- for advent .

he wrote two hymns on the ten commandments , `` dies sind die heilgen zehn gebot '' and `` mensch , willst du leben seliglich '' . 
it became known as the german te deum . 
luther 's 1541 hymn `` christ unser herr zum jordan kam '' -lrb- `` to jordan came the christ our lord '' -rrb- reflects the structure and substance of his questions and answers concerning baptism in the small catechism . 
luther adopted a preexisting johann walter tune associated with a hymnic setting of psalm 67 's prayer for grace ; wolf heintz 's four-part setting of the hymn was used to introduce the lutheran reformation in halle in 1541 .

preachers and composers of the 18th century , including j. s. bach , used this rich hymn as a subject for their own work , although its objective baptismal theology was displaced by more subjective hymns under the influence of late-19th-century lutheran pietism .

johann sebastian bach included several verses as chorales in his cantatas and based chorale cantatas entirely on them , namely christ lag in todes banden , bwv 4 , as early as possibly 1707 , in his second annual cycle -lrb- 1724 to 1725 -rrb- ach gott , vom himmel sieh darein , bwv 2 , christ unser herr zum jordan kam , bwv 7 , nun komm , der heiden heiland , bwv 62 , gelobet seist du , jesu christ , bwv 91 , and aus tiefer not schrei ich zu dir , bwv 38 , later ein feste burg ist unser gott , bwv 80 , and in 1735 wär gott nicht mit uns diese zeit , bwv 14 .

in contrast to the views of john calvin and philipp melanchthon , throughout his life luther maintained that it was not false doctrine to believe that a christian 's soul sleeps after it is separated from the body in death ; and , accordingly , he disputed traditional interpretations of some bible passages , such as the parable of the rich man and lazarus . 
this also led luther to reject the idea of torments for the saints : `` it is enough for us to know that souls do not leave their bodies to be threatened by the torments and punishments of hell , but enter a prepared bedchamber in which they sleep in peace . ''

he also rejected the existence of purgatory , which involved christian souls undergoing penitential suffering after death . 
in his smalcald articles , he described the saints as currently residing `` in their graves and in heaven . '' 
the lutheran theologian franz pieper observed that luther 's teaching about the state of the christian 's soul after death differed from the later lutheran theologians such as johann gerhard .

lessing -lrb- 1755 -rrb- had earlier reached the same conclusion in his analysis of lutheran orthodoxy on this issue . 
luther 's commentary on genesis contains a passage which concludes that `` the soul does not sleep -lrb- anima non sic dormit -rrb- , but wakes -lrb- sed vigilat -rrb- and experiences visions '' . 
francis blackburne in 1765 argued that john jortin misread this and other passages from luther , while gottfried fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man `` in this life '' -lrb- homo enim in hac vita -rrb- tired from his daily labour -lrb- defatigus diurno labore -rrb- who at night enters his bedchamber -lrb- sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum -rrb- and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .

agreement was achieved on fourteen points out of fifteen , the exception being the nature of the eucharist -- the sacrament of the lord 's supper -- an issue crucial to luther .

the theologians , including zwingli , melanchthon , martin bucer , and johannes oecolampadius , differed on the significance of the words spoken by jesus at the last supper : `` this is my body which is for you '' and `` this cup is the new covenant in my blood '' -lrb- 1 corinthians 11:23 -- 26 -rrb- . 
luther insisted on the real presence of the body and blood of christ in the consecrated bread and wine , which he called the sacramental union , while his opponents believed god to be only spiritually or symbolically present .

according to transcripts , the debate sometimes became confrontational . 
despite the disagreements on the eucharist , the marburg colloquy paved the way for the signing in 1530 of the augsburg confession , and for the formation of the schmalkaldic league the following year by leading protestant nobles such as john of saxony , philip of hesse , and george , margrave of brandenburg-ansbach .

some scholars have asserted that luther taught that faith and reason were antithetical in the sense that questions of faith could not be illuminated by reason .

and '' -lsb- that -rsb- reason in no way contributes to faith . 
-lsb- ... -rsb- for reason is the greatest enemy that faith has ; it never comes to the aid of spiritual things . '' 
luther 's concern thus in separating them is honoring their different epistemological spheres . 
in 1523 , luther wrote that jesus christ was born a jew which discouraged mistreatment of the jews and advocated their conversion by proving that the old testament could be shown to speak of jesus christ . 
however , as the reformation continued , luther began to lose hope in large-scale jewish conversion to christianity . 
in his later years , luther grew more hostile toward the jews , writing against them with the kind of venom he had already unleashed on the anabaptists , zwinglianism , and the papacy .

his 1543 treatise von den juden und ihren lügen -lrb- on the jews and their lies -rrb- took its place among other anti-jewish literature of the times , although historians acknowledge that this treatise was particularly extreme , even by the standards of sixteenth century europe .

by 1529 , in on war against the turk , he was actively urging emperor charles v and the german people to fight a secular war against the turks . 
in 1542 , luther read a latin translation of the qur ` an . 
he went on to produce several critical pamphlets on islam , which he called `` mohammedanism '' or `` the turk '' . 
he went on to produce several critical pamphlets on islam , which he called `` mohammedanism '' or `` the turk '' . 
though luther saw the muslim faith as a tool of the devil , he was indifferent to its practice : `` let the turk believe and live as he will , just as one lets the papacy and other false christians live . '' 
he opposed banning the publication of the qur ` an , wanting it exposed to scrutiny . 
early in 1537 , johannes agricola -lrb- 1494 -- 1566 -rrb- -- serving at the time as pastor in luther 's birthplace , eisleben -- preached a sermon in which he claimed that god 's gospel , not god 's moral law -lrb- the ten commandments -rrb- , revealed god 's wrath to christians .

these theses asserted that the law is no longer to be taught to christians but belonged only to city hall . 
luther responded to these theses with six series of theses against agricola and the antinomians , four of which became the basis for disputations between 1538 and 1540 . 
he also responded to these assertions in other writings , such as his 1539 open letter to c. güttel against the antinomians , and his book on the councils and the church from the same year . 
in his theses and disputations against the antinomians , luther reviews and reaffirms , on the one hand , what has been called the `` second use of the law , '' that is , the law as the holy spirit 's tool to work sorrow over sin in man 's heart , thus preparing him for christ 's fulfillment of the law offered in the gospel .

luther states that everything that is used to work sorrow over sin is called the law , even if it is christ 's life , christ 's death for sin , or god 's goodness experienced in creation . 
simply refusing to preach the ten commandments among christians -- thereby , as it were , removing the three letters l-a-w from the church -- does not eliminate the accusing law . 
claiming that the law -- in any form -- should not be preached to christians anymore would be tantamount to asserting that christians are no longer sinners in themselves and that the church consists only of essentially holy people . 
on the other hand , luther also points out that the ten commandments -- when considered not as god 's condemning judgment but as an expression of his eternal will , that is , of the natural law -- also positively teach how the christian ought to live .

this has traditionally been called the `` third use of the law . '' 
for luther , also christ 's life , when understood as an example , is nothing more than an illustration of the ten commandments , which a christian should follow in his or her vocations on a daily basis .

the ten commandments , and the beginnings of the renewed life of christians accorded to them by the sacrament of baptism , are a present foreshadowing of the believers ' future angel-like life in heaven in the midst of this life . 
luther 's teaching of the ten commandments , therefore , has clear eschatological overtones , which , characteristically for luther , do not encourage world-flight but direct the christian to service to the neighbor in the common , daily vocations of this perishing world . 
from december 1539 , luther became implicated in the bigamy of philip i , landgrave of hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting .

from december 1539 , luther became implicated in the bigamy of philip i , landgrave of hesse , who wanted to marry one of his wife 's ladies-in-waiting . 
in the view of luther 's biographer martin brecht , `` giving confessional advice for philip of hesse was one of the worst mistakes luther made , and , next to the landgrave himself , who was directly responsible for it , history chiefly holds luther accountable '' . 
the affair caused lasting damage to luther 's reputation . 
luther rarely encountered jews during his life , but his attitudes reflected a theological and cultural tradition which saw jews as a rejected people guilty of the murder of christ , and he lived within a local community that had expelled jews some ninety years earlier .

he considered the jews blasphemers and liars because they rejected the divinity of jesus , whereas christians believed jesus was the messiah . 
in 1523 , luther advised kindness toward the jews in that jesus christ was born a jew and also aimed to convert them to christianity . 
luther 's other major works on the jews were his 60,000-word treatise von den juden und ihren lügen -lrb- on the jews and their lies -rrb- , and vom schem hamphoras und vom geschlecht christi -lrb- on the holy name and the lineage of christ -rrb- , both published in 1543 , three years before his death .

luther argued that the jews were no longer the chosen people but `` the devil 's people '' , and referred to them with violent , vile language . 
in robert michael 's view , luther 's words `` we are at fault in not slaying them '' amounted to a sanction for murder . 
luther spoke out against the jews in saxony , brandenburg , and silesia . 
josel of rosheim , the jewish spokesman who tried to help the jews of saxony in 1537 , later blamed their plight on `` that priest whose name was martin luther -- may his body and soul be bound up in hell ! 
-- who wrote and issued many heretical books in which he said that whoever would help the jews was doomed to perdition . '' 
josel asked the city of strasbourg to forbid the sale of luther 's anti-jewish works : they refused initially , but did so when a lutheran pastor in hochfelden used a sermon to urge his parishioners to murder jews . 
throughout the 1580s , riots led to the expulsion of jews from several german lutheran states . 
luther was the most widely read author of his generation , and within germany he acquired the status of a prophet . 
according to the prevailing view among historians , his anti-jewish rhetoric contributed significantly to the development of antisemitism in germany , and in the 1930s and 1940s provided an `` ideal underpinning '' for the nazis ' attacks on jews .

according to michael , just about every anti-jewish book printed in the third reich contained references to and quotations from luther . 
the city of nuremberg presented a first edition of on the jews and their lies to julius streicher , editor of the nazi newspaper der stürmer , on his birthday in 1937 ; the newspaper described it as the most radically anti-semitic tract ever published . 
on 17 december 1941 , seven protestant regional church confederations issued a statement agreeing with the policy of forcing jews to wear the yellow badge , `` since after his bitter experience luther had already suggested preventive measures against the jews and their expulsion from german territory .

according to daniel goldhagen , bishop martin sasse , a leading protestant churchman , published a compendium of luther 's writings shortly after kristallnacht , for which diarmaid macculloch , professor of the history of the church in the university of oxford argued that luther 's writing was a `` blueprint .

the german people , he urged , ought to heed these words `` of the greatest antisemite of his time , the warner of his people against the jews . '' 
some scholars see luther 's influence as limited , and the nazis ' use of his work as opportunistic . 
nevertheless , his misguided agitation had the evil result that luther fatefully became one of the ` church fathers ' of anti-semitism and thus provided material for the modern hatred of the jews , cloaking it with the authority of the reformer . ''

johannes wallmann argues that luther 's writings against the jews were largely ignored in the 18th and 19th centuries , and that there was no continuity between luther 's thought and nazi ideology . 
his position was entirely religious and in no respect racial . '' 
other scholars argue that , even if his views were merely anti-judaic -- that is , opposed to judaism and its adherence rather than the jews as an ethnic group -- their violence lent a new element to the standard christian suspicion of judaism . 
ronald berger writes that luther is credited with `` germanizing the christian critique of judaism and establishing anti-semitism as a key element of german culture and national identity . '' 
paul rose argues that he caused a `` hysterical and demonizing mentality '' about jews to enter german thought and discourse , a mentality that might otherwise have been absent . 
christopher j. probst in his book demonizing the jews : luther and the protestant church in nazi germany -lrb- 2012 -rrb- , shows that a large number of german lutheran clergy and theologians during the nazi third reich used luther 's hostile publications towards the jews and their jewish religion to justify at least in part the anti-semitic policies of the national socialists .

some scholars , such as mark u. edwards in his book luther 's last battles : politics and polemics 1531 -- 46 -lrb- 1983 -rrb- , suggest that since luther 's increasingly antisemitic views developed during the years his health deteriorated , it is possible they were at least partly the product of a declining state of mind .

edwards also comments that luther often deliberately used `` vulgarity and violence '' for effect , both in his writings condemning the jews and in diatribes against `` turks '' -lrb- muslims -rrb- and catholics .

since the 1980s , lutheran church denominations have repudiated martin luther 's statements against the jews and have rejected the use of them to incite hatred against lutherans . 
strommen et al. 's 1970 survey of 4,745 north american lutherans aged 15 -- 65 found that , compared to the other minority groups under consideration , lutherans were the least prejudiced toward jews . 
nevertheless , professor richard -lrb- dick -rrb- geary , former professor of modern history at the university of nottingham , england , and the author of hitler and nazism -lrb- routledge 1993 -rrb- , wrote in the journal history today an article on who voted for the nazis in elections held from 1928-1933 , where he claimed that from his research he found that the nazis gained disproportionately more votes from protestant than catholic areas of germany .

from 1531 to 1546 , his health deteriorated further . 
the years of struggle with rome , the antagonisms with and among his fellow reformers , and the scandal which ensued from the bigamy of the philip of hesse incident , in which luther had played a leading role , all may have contributed . 
in 1536 , he began to suffer from kidney and bladder stones , and arthritis , and an ear infection ruptured an ear drum .

luther said , `` we want to practice christian love toward them and pray that they convert , '' but also that they are `` our public enemies ... and if they could kill us all , they would gladly do so . 
luther 's final journey , to mansfeld , was taken because of his concern for his siblings ' families continuing in their father hans luther 's copper mining trade . 
luther journeyed to mansfeld twice in late 1545 to participate in the negotiations for a settlement , and a third visit was needed in early 1546 for their completion .

in the 1530s and 1540s , printed images of luther that emphasized his monumental size were crucial to the spread of protestantism . 
in contrast to images of frail catholic saints , luther was presented as a stout man with a `` double chin , strong mouth , piercing deep-set eyes , fleshy face , and squat neck . '' 
he was shown to be physically imposing , an equal in stature to the secular german princes with whom he would join forces to spread lutheranism . 
his large body also let the viewer know that he did not shun earthly pleasures like drinking -- behavior that was a stark contrast to the ascetic life of the medieval religious orders .

corliss , and later , poppet valve gears had separate admission and exhaust valves driven by trip mechanisms or cams profiled so as to give ideal events ; most of these gears never succeeded outside of the stationary marketplace due to various other issues including leakage and more delicate mechanisms . 
this expedient has since been generally considered satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler stephenson , joy and walschaerts motions . 
the usual compromise solution has been to provide lap by lengthening rubbing surfaces of the valve in such a way as to overlap the port on the admission side , with the effect that the exhaust side remains open for a longer period after cut-off on the admission side has occurred .

steam turbines are generally more efficient than reciprocating piston type steam engines -lrb- for outputs above several hundred horsepower -rrb- , have fewer moving parts , and provide rotary power directly instead of through a connecting rod system or similar means . 
in the united states 90 % of the electric power is produced in this way using a variety of heat sources . 
today most electric power is provided by steam turbines . 
the heat required for boiling the water and supplying the steam can be derived from various sources , most commonly from burning combustible materials with an appropriate supply of air in a closed space -lrb- called variously combustion chamber , firebox -rrb- .

in some cases the heat source is a nuclear reactor , geothermal energy , solar energy or waste heat from an internal combustion engine or industrial process . 
in the case of model or toy steam engines , the heat source can be an electric heating element . 
the most useful instrument for analyzing the performance of steam engines is the steam engine indicator . 
early versions were in use by 1851 , but the most successful indicator was developed for the high speed engine inventor and manufacturer charles porter by charles richard and exhibited at london exhibition in 1862 .

with two-cylinder compounds used in railway work , the pistons are connected to the cranks as with a two-cylinder simple at 90 ° out of phase with each other -lrb- quartered -rrb- . 
when the double expansion group is duplicated , producing a 4-cylinder compound , the individual pistons within the group are usually balanced at 180 ° , the groups being set at 90 ° to each other .

in most reciprocating piston engines , the steam reverses its direction of flow at each stroke -lrb- counterflow -rrb- , entering and exhausting from the cylinder by the same port . 
the complete engine cycle occupies one rotation of the crank and two piston strokes ; the cycle also comprises four events -- admission , expansion , exhaust , compression .

the quasiturbine is a uniflow rotary steam engine where steam intakes in hot areas , while exhausting in cold areas . 
uniflow engines attempt to remedy the difficulties arising from the usual counterflow cycle where , during each stroke , the port and the cylinder walls will be cooled by the passing exhaust steam , whilst the hotter incoming admission steam will waste some of its energy in restoring working temperature . 
the aim of the uniflow is to remedy this defect and improve efficiency by providing an additional port uncovered by the piston at the end of each stroke making the steam flow only in one direction . 
an oscillating cylinder steam engine is a variant of the simple expansion steam engine which does not require valves to direct steam into and out of the cylinder . 
instead of valves , the entire cylinder rocks , or oscillates , such that one or more holes in the cylinder line up with holes in a fixed port face or in the pivot mounting -lrb- trunnion -rrb- . 
these engines are mainly used in toys and models , because of their simplicity , but have also been used in full size working engines , mainly on ships where their compactness is valued .

the working fluid in a rankine cycle can operate as a closed loop system , where the working fluid is recycled continuously , or may be an `` open loop '' system , where the exhaust steam is directly released to the atmosphere , and a separate source of water feeding the boiler is supplied .

mercury is the working fluid in the mercury vapor turbine . 
normally water is the fluid of choice due to its favourable properties , such as non-toxic and unreactive chemistry , abundance , low cost , and its thermodynamic properties . 
the efficiency of a rankine cycle is usually limited by the working fluid . 
without the pressure reaching supercritical levels for the working fluid , the temperature range the cycle can operate over is quite small ; in steam turbines , turbine entry temperatures are typically 565 °c -lrb- the creep limit of stainless steel -rrb- and condenser temperatures are around 30 °c .

this gives a theoretical carnot efficiency of about 63 % compared with an actual efficiency of 42 % for a modern coal-fired power station .

by staging the expansion in multiple cylinders , torque variability can be reduced . 
to derive equal work from lower-pressure steam requires a larger cylinder volume as this steam occupies a greater volume . 
the main use for steam turbines is in electricity generation -lrb- in the 1990s about 90 % of the world 's electric production was by use of steam turbines -rrb- however the recent widespread application of large gas turbine units and typical combined cycle power plants has resulted in reduction of this percentage to the 80 % regime for steam turbines .

the rankine cycle is the fundamental thermodynamic underpinning of the steam engine . 
the heat is supplied externally to a closed loop with some of the heat added being converted to work and the waste heat being removed in a condenser . 
in the 1990s , rankine steam cycles generated about 90 % of all electric power used throughout the world , including virtually all solar , biomass , coal and nuclear power plants .

it is named after william john macquorn rankine , a scottish polymath . 
the historical measure of a steam engine 's energy efficiency was its `` duty '' . 
watt 's original low-pressure designs were able to deliver duty as high as 25 million , but averaged about 17 . 
the best examples of newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 million , but most were closer to 5 million . 
duty is the number of foot-pounds of work delivered by burning one bushel -lrb- 94 pounds -rrb- of coal . 
the concept of duty was first introduced by watt in order to illustrate how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier newcomen designs . 
reciprocating piston type steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century , when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating -lrb- piston -rrb- steam engines in commercial usage , and the ascendancy of steam turbines in power generation .

considering that the great majority of worldwide electric generation is produced by turbine type steam engines , the `` steam age '' is continuing with energy levels far beyond those of the turn of the 19th century .

these were much more powerful for a given cylinder size than previous engines and could be made small enough for transport applications . 
thereafter , technological developments and improvements in manufacturing techniques -lrb- partly brought about by the adoption of the steam engine as a power source -rrb- resulted in the design of more efficient engines that could be smaller , faster , or more powerful , depending on the intended application .

a dry type cooling tower is similar to an automobile radiator and is used in locations where water is costly . 
evaporative -lrb- wet -rrb- cooling towers use the rejected heat to evaporate water ; this water is kept separate from the condensate , which circulates in a closed system and returns to the boiler . 
evaporative cooling towers need less water flow than `` once-through '' cooling by river or lake water ; a 700 megawatt coal-fired power plant may use about 3600 cubic metres of make-up water every hour for evaporative cooling , but would need about twenty times as much if cooled by river water .

the centrifugal governor was adopted by james watt for use on a steam engine in 1788 after watt 's partner boulton saw one at a flour mill boulton & watt were building . 
as a consequence , engines equipped only with this governor were not suitable for operations requiring constant speed , such as cotton spinning . 
the governor could not actually hold a set speed , because it would assume a new constant speed in response to load changes . 
the adoption of compounding was common for industrial units , for road engines and almost universal for marine engines after 1880 ; it was not universally popular in railway locomotives where it was often perceived as complicated .

most however have a reversing mechanism which additionally can provide means for saving steam as speed and momentum are gained by gradually `` shortening the cutoff '' or rather , shortening the admission event ; this in turn proportionately lengthens the expansion period . 
however , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression -lrb- `` kick back '' -rrb- .

the simplest valve gears give events of fixed length during the engine cycle and often make the engine rotate in only one direction .

typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute -lrb- rpm -rrb- in the usa with 60 hertz power , 3000 rpm in europe and other countries with 50 hertz electric power systems . 
the weight of boilers and condensers generally makes the power-to-weight ratio of a steam plant lower than for internal combustion engines . 
for mobile applications steam has been largely superseded by internal combustion engines or electric motors . 
however , most electric power is generated using steam turbine plant , so that indirectly the world 's industry is still dependent on steam power . 
this is becoming known as the advanced steam movement . 
recent concerns about fuel sources and pollution have incited a renewed interest in steam both as a component of cogeneration processes and as a prime mover . 
it is possible to use a mechanism based on a pistonless rotary engine such as the wankel engine in place of the cylinders and valve gear of a conventional reciprocating steam engine .

the major problem is the difficulty of sealing the rotors to make them steam-tight in the face of wear and thermal expansion ; the resulting leakage made them very inefficient .

boulton and watt 's early engines used half as much coal as john smeaton 's improved version of newcomen 's . 
they were powered by air pressure pushing a piston into the partial vacuum generated by condensing steam , instead of the pressure of expanding steam . 
steam engines frequently possess two independent mechanisms for ensuring that the pressure in the boiler does not go too high ; one may be adjusted by the user , the second is typically designed as an ultimate fail-safe . 
such safety valves traditionally used a simple lever to restrain a plug valve in the top of a boiler . 
the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken . 
the more recent type of safety valve uses an adjustable spring-loaded valve , which is locked such that operators may not tamper with its adjustment unless a seal illegally is broken . 
early valves could be adjusted by engine drivers , leading to many accidents when a driver fastened the valve down to allow greater steam pressure and more power from the engine .

when corliss was given the rumford medal the committee said that `` no one invention since watt 's time has so enhanced the efficiency of the steam engine '' . 
the steam engine contributed much to the development of thermodynamic theory ; however , the only applications of scientific theory that influenced the steam engine were the original concepts of harnessing the power of steam and atmospheric pressure and knowledge of properties of heat and steam .

by condensing the fluid , the work required by the pump consumes only 1 % to 3 % of the turbine power and contributes to a much higher efficiency for a real cycle . 
gas turbines , for instance , have turbine entry temperatures approaching 1500 °c .

fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity ; an ignition event , such as heat or a spark , is needed to trigger combustion . 
oxygen is the oxidant , not the fuel , but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion . 
combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential , such as peroxides , chlorates , nitrates , perchlorates , and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire .

using a cascade method , swiss chemist and physicist raoul pierre pictet evaporated liquid sulfur dioxide in order to liquefy carbon dioxide , which in turn was evaporated to cool oxygen gas enough to liquefy it . 
only a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analysis could be conducted . 
oxygen was liquified in stable state for the first time on march 29 , 1883 by polish scientists from jagiellonian university , zygmunt wróblewski and karol olszewski .

singlet oxygen is a name given to several higher-energy species of molecular o 2 in which all the electron spins are paired . 
it is much more reactive towards common organic molecules than is molecular oxygen per se . 
in nature , singlet oxygen is commonly formed from water during photosynthesis , using the energy of sunlight . 
it is also produced in the troposphere by the photolysis of ozone by light of short wavelength , and by the immune system as a source of active oxygen . 
carotenoids in photosynthetic organisms -lrb- and possibly also in animals -rrb- play a major role in absorbing energy from singlet oxygen and converting it to the unexcited ground state before it can cause harm to tissues .

liquid oxygen is attracted to a magnet to a sufficient extent that , in laboratory demonstrations , a bridge of liquid oxygen may be supported against its own weight between the poles of a powerful magnet . 
that is , they impart magnetic character to oxygen when it is in the presence of a magnetic field , because of the spin magnetic moments of the unpaired electrons in the molecule , and the negative exchange energy between neighboring o 2 molecules .

both liquid and solid o 2 are clear substances with a light sky-blue color caused by absorption in the red -lrb- in contrast with the blue color of the sky , which is due to rayleigh scattering of blue light -rrb- . 
high-purity liquid o 2 is usually obtained by the fractional distillation of liquefied air . 
liquid oxygen may also be produced by condensation out of air , using liquid nitrogen as a coolant .

water polluted with plant nutrients such as nitrates or phosphates may stimulate growth of algae by a process called eutrophication and the decay of these organisms and other biomaterials may reduce amounts of o 2 in eutrophic water bodies . 
scientists assess this aspect of water quality by measuring the water 's biochemical oxygen demand , or the amount of o 2 needed to restore it to a normal concentration . 
free oxygen gas was almost nonexistent in earth 's atmosphere before photosynthetic archaea and bacteria evolved , probably about 3.5 billion years ago . 
free oxygen first appeared in significant quantities during the paleoproterozoic eon -lrb- between 3.0 and 2.3 billion years ago -rrb- . 
for the first billion years , any free oxygen produced by these organisms combined with dissolved iron in the oceans to form banded iron formations . 
when such oxygen sinks became saturated , free oxygen began to outgas from the oceans 3 -- 2.7 billion years ago , reaching 10 % of its present level around 1.7 billion years ago .

professional athletes , especially in american football , also sometimes go off field between plays to wear oxygen masks in order to get a `` boost '' in performance . 
the pharmacological effect is doubtful ; a placebo effect is a more likely explanation . 
available studies support a performance boost from enriched o 2 mixtures only if they are breathed during aerobic exercise . 
hyperbaric -lrb- high-pressure -rrb- medicine uses special oxygen chambers to increase the partial pressure of o 2 around the patient and , when needed , the medical staff . 
increased o 2 concentration in the lungs helps to displace carbon monoxide from the heme group of hemoglobin . 
oxygen gas is poisonous to the anaerobic bacteria that cause gas gangrene , so increasing its partial pressure helps kill them . 
decompression sickness occurs in divers who decompress too quickly after a dive , resulting in bubbles of inert gas , mostly nitrogen and helium , forming in their blood . 
oxygen therapy is used to treat emphysema , pneumonia , some heart disorders -lrb- congestive heart failure -rrb- , some disorders that cause increased pulmonary artery pressure , and any disease that impairs the body 's ability to take up and use gaseous oxygen . 
treatment not only increases oxygen levels in the patient 's blood , but has the secondary effect of decreasing resistance to blood flow in many types of diseased lungs , easing work load on the heart .

only a few common complex biomolecules , such as squalene and the carotenes , contain no oxygen . 
of the organic compounds with biological relevance , carbohydrates contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen . 
all fats , fatty acids , amino acids , and proteins contain oxygen -lrb- due to the presence of carbonyl groups in these acids and their ester residues -rrb- . 
oxygen also occurs in phosphate -lrb- po3 − 4 -rrb- groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules atp and adp , in the backbone and the purines -lrb- except adenine -rrb- and pyrimidines of rna and dna , and in bones as calcium phosphate and hydroxylapatite . 
oxygen toxicity to the lungs and central nervous system can also occur in deep scuba diving and surface supplied diving . 
prolonged breathing of an air mixture with an o 2 partial pressure more than 60 kpa can eventually lead to permanent pulmonary fibrosis .

the 1973 oil crisis began in october 1973 when the members of the organization of arab petroleum exporting countries -lrb- oapec , consisting of the arab members of opec plus egypt and syria -rrb- proclaimed an oil embargo . 
by the end of the embargo in march 1974 , the price of oil had risen from us$ 3 per barrel to nearly $ 12 globally ; us prices were significantly higher . 
it was later called the `` first oil shock '' , followed by the 1979 oil crisis , termed the `` second oil shock . ''

some european nations and japan sought to disassociate themselves from united states foreign policy in the middle east to avoid being targeted by the boycott . 
they arranged for israel to pull back from the sinai peninsula and the golan heights . 
by january 18 , 1974 , us secretary of state henry kissinger had negotiated an israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the sinai peninsula . 
the promise of a negotiated settlement between israel and syria was enough to convince arab oil producers to lift the embargo in march 1974 . 
on august 15 , 1971 , the united states unilaterally pulled out of the bretton woods accord . 
the us abandoned the gold exchange standard whereby the value of the dollar had been pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the dollar , whose value was left to `` float '' -lrb- rise and fall according to market demand -rrb- . 
anticipating that currency values would fluctuate unpredictably for a time , the industrialized nations increased their reserves -lrb- by expanding their money supplies -rrb- in amounts far greater than before . 
in september 1971 , opec issued a joint communiqué stating that , from then on , they would price oil in terms of a fixed amount of gold . 
because oil was priced in dollars , oil producers ' real income decreased . 
from 1947 to 1967 , the dollar price of oil had risen by less than two percent per year . 
after 1971 , opec was slow to readjust prices to reflect this depreciation . 
the substantial price increases of 1973 -- 1974 largely returned their prices and corresponding incomes to bretton woods levels in terms of commodities such as gold . 
until the oil shock , the price had also remained fairly stable versus other currencies and commodities . 
on october 6 , 1973 , syria and egypt , with support from other arab nations , launched a surprise attack on israel , on yom kippur . 
at the time , iran was the world 's second-largest oil exporter and a close us ally .

the following day , oil ministers agreed to the embargo , a cut in production by five percent from september 's output and to continue to cut production in five percent monthly increments until their economic and political objectives were met . 
on october 19 , nixon requested congress to appropriate $ 2.2 billion in emergency aid to israel , including $ 1.5 billion in outright grants .

saudi arabia spent over 100 billion dollars in the ensuing decades for helping spread its fundamentalist interpretation of islam , known as wahhabism , throughout the world , via religious charities such al-haramain foundation , which often also distributed funds to violent sunni extremist groups such as al-qaeda and the taliban .

much went for arms purchases that exacerbated political tensions , particularly in the middle east . 
some of the income was dispensed in the form of aid to other underdeveloped nations whose economies had been caught between higher oil prices and lower prices for their own export commodities , amid shrinking western demand .

in the us production , distribution and price disruptions `` have been held responsible for recessions , periods of excessive inflation , reduced productivity , and lower economic growth . '' 
the possibility that the middle east could become another superpower confrontation with the ussr was of more concern to the us than oil . 
in the united states , scholars argue that there already existed a negotiated settlement based on equality between both parties prior to 1973 . 
further , interest groups and government agencies more worried about energy were no match for kissinger 's dominance . 
the embargo had a negative influence on the us economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to u.s. energy security . 
on an international level , the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries , such as automobiles . 
macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts . 
the embargo left oil companies searching for new ways to increase oil supplies , even in rugged terrain such as the arctic . 
finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to ten years before significant production . 
of the nine members of the european economic community -lrb- eec -rrb- , the netherlands faced a complete embargo , the uk and france received almost uninterrupted supplies -lrb- having refused to allow america to use their airfields and embargoed arms and supplies to both the arabs and the israelis -rrb- , while the other six faced partial cutbacks .

development of the strategic petroleum reserve began in 1975 , and in 1977 the cabinet-level department of energy was created , followed by the national energy act of 1978 . 
the energy crisis led to greater interest in renewable energy , nuclear power and domestic fossil fuels . 
there is criticism that american energy policies since the crisis have been dominated by crisis-mentality thinking , promoting expensive quick fixes and single-shot solutions that ignore market and technology realities . 
instead of providing stable rules that support basic research while leaving plenty of scope for entrepreneurship and innovation , congresses and presidents have repeatedly backed policies which promise solutions that are politically expedient , but whose prospects are doubtful . 
in 2004 , declassified documents revealed that the u.s. was so distraught by the rise in oil prices and being challenged by under-developed countries that they briefly considered military action to forcibly seize middle eastern oilfields in late 1973 . 
british prime minister edward heath was so worried by this prospect that he ordered a british intelligence estimate of u.s. intentions , which concluded america `` might consider it could not tolerate a situation in which the u.s. and its allies were at the mercy of a small group of unreasonable countries , '' and that they would prefer a rapid operation to seize oilfields in saudi arabia and kuwait , and possibly abu dhabi in military action was decided upon . 
although the soviet response to such an act would likely not involve force , intelligence warned `` the american occupation would need to last 10 years as the west developed alternative energy sources , and would result in the ` total alienation ' of the arabs and much of the rest of the third world . ''

'' 
although lacking historical connections to the middle east , japan was the country most dependent on arab oil . 
71 % of its imported oil came from the middle east in 1970 . 
it received a 5 % production cut in december , causing a panic . 
on november 22 , japan issued a statement `` asserting that israel should withdraw from all of the 1967 territories , advocating palestinian self-determination , and threatening to reconsider its policy toward israel if israel refused to accept these preconditions '' . 
by december 25 , japan was considered an arab-friendly state . 
the ussr 's invasion of afghanistan was only one sign of insecurity in the region , also marked by increased american weapons sales , technology , and outright military presence . 
saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues . 
saudi arabia and iran became increasingly dependent on american security assurances to manage both external and internal threats , including increased military competition between them over increased oil revenues . 
another motive for the large scale purchase of arms from the us by saudi arabia was the failure of the shah during january 1979 to maintain control of iran , a non-arabic but largely shiite muslim nation , which fell to a theocratic islamist government under the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in the wake of the 1979 iranian revolution . 
in the wake of the iranian revolution the saudis were forced to deal with the prospect of internal destabilization via the radicalism of islamism , a reality which would quickly be revealed in the seizure of the grand mosque in mecca by wahhabi extremists during november 1979 and a shiite revolt in the oil rich al-hasa region of saudi arabia in december of the same year . 
the crisis reduced the demand for large cars . 
japanese imports , primarily the toyota corona , the toyota corolla , the datsun b210 , the datsun 510 , the honda civic , the mitsubishi galant -lrb- a captive import from chrysler sold as the dodge colt -rrb- , the subaru dl , and later the honda accord all had four cylinder engines that were more fuel efficient than the typical american v8 and six cylinder engines .

japanese imports became mass-market leaders with unibody construction and front-wheel drive , which became de facto standards . 
a decade after the 1973 oil crisis , honda , toyota and nissan , affected by the 1981 voluntary export restraints , opened us assembly plants and established their luxury divisions -lrb- acura , lexus and infiniti , respectively -rrb- to distinguish themselves from their mass-market brands . 
some buyers lamented the small size of the first japanese compacts , and both toyota and nissan -lrb- then known as datsun -rrb- introduced larger cars such as the toyota corona mark ii , the toyota cressida , the mazda 616 and datsun 810 , which added passenger space and amenities such as air conditioning , power steering , am-fm radios , and even power windows and central locking without increasing the price of the vehicle .

compact trucks were introduced , such as the toyota hilux and the datsun truck , followed by the mazda truck -lrb- sold as the ford courier -rrb- , and the isuzu-built chevrolet luv . 
mitsubishi rebranded its forte as the dodge d-50 a few years after the oil crisis . 
mazda , mitsubishi and isuzu had joint partnerships with ford , chrysler , and gm , respectively . 
later the american makers introduced their domestic replacements -lrb- ford ranger , dodge dakota and the chevrolet s10/gmc s-15 -rrb- , ending their captive import policy . 
an increase in imported cars into north america forced general motors , ford and chrysler to introduce smaller and fuel-efficient models for domestic sales . 
the dodge omni / plymouth horizon from chrysler , the ford fiesta and the chevrolet chevette all had four-cylinder engines and room for at least four passengers by the late 1970s . 
by 1985 , the average american vehicle moved 17.4 miles per gallon , compared to 13.5 in 1970 . 
the cadillac deville and fleetwood , buick electra , oldsmobile 98 , lincoln continental , mercury marquis , and various other luxury oriented sedans became popular again in the mid-1970s . 
the only full-size models that did not recover were lower price models such as the chevrolet bel air , and ford galaxie 500 . 
by 1979 , virtually all `` full-size '' american cars had shrunk , featuring smaller engines and smaller outside dimensions . 
chrysler ended production of their full-sized luxury sedans at the end of the 1981 model year , moving instead to a full front-wheel drive lineup for 1982 -lrb- except for the m-body dodge diplomat/plymouth gran fury and chrysler new yorker fifth avenue sedans -rrb- . 
federal safety standards , such as nhtsa federal motor vehicle safety standard 215 -lrb- pertaining to safety bumpers -rrb- , and compacts like the 1974 mustang i were a prelude to the dot `` downsize '' revision of vehicle categories . 
opec soon lost its preeminent position , and in 1981 , its production was surpassed by that of other countries . 
the world price , which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $ 40 per barrel , decreased during the 1980s to less than $ 10 per barrel .

first conceived during dwight d. eisenhower 's administration as a three-man spacecraft to follow the one-man project mercury which put the first americans in space , apollo was later dedicated to president john f. kennedy 's national goal of `` landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth '' by the end of the 1960s , which he proposed in a may 25 , 1961 , address to congress . 
the apollo program , also known as project apollo , was the third united states human spaceflight program carried out by the national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- , which accomplished landing the first humans on the moon from 1969 to 1972 .

the program returned 842 pounds -lrb- 382 kg -rrb- of lunar rocks and soil to earth , greatly contributing to the understanding of the moon 's composition and geological history . 
apollo also spurred advances in many areas of technology incidental to rocketry and manned spaceflight , including avionics , telecommunications , and computers . 
while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts . 
while the mercury capsule could only support one astronaut on a limited earth orbital mission , apollo would carry three astronauts . 
the program was named after the greek god of light , music , and the sun by nasa manager abe silverstein , who later said that `` i was naming the spacecraft like i 'd name my baby . '' 
possible missions included ferrying crews to a space station , circumlunar flights , and eventual manned lunar landings . 
the apollo program was conceived during the eisenhower administration in early 1960 , as a follow-up to project mercury . 
in july 1960 , nasa deputy administrator hugh l. dryden announced the apollo program to industry representatives at a series of space task group conferences . 
meanwhile , nasa performed its own in-house spacecraft design studies led by maxime faget , to serve as a gauge to judge and monitor the three industry designs . 
on august 30 , a feasibility study competition was announced , and on october 25 , three study contracts were awarded to general dynamics/convair , general electric , and the glenn l. martin company .

in november 1960 , john f. kennedy was elected president after a campaign that promised american superiority over the soviet union in the fields of space exploration and missile defense . 
he knew little about the technical details of the space program , and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned moon landing . 
when kennedy 's newly appointed nasa administrator james e. webb requested a 30 percent budget increase for his agency , kennedy supported an acceleration of nasa 's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue . 
up to the election of 1960 , kennedy had been speaking out against the `` missile gap '' that he and many other senators felt had formed between the soviets and themselves due to the inaction of president eisenhower . 
on april 12 , 1961 , soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person to fly in space , reinforcing american fears about being left behind in a technological competition with the soviet union .

at a meeting of the us house committee on science and astronautics one day after gagarin 's flight , many congressmen pledged their support for a crash program aimed at ensuring that america would catch up . 
kennedy was circumspect in his response to the news , refusing to make a commitment on america 's response to the soviets .

it was also clear nasa would soon outgrow its practice of controlling missions from its cape canaveral air force station launch facilities in florida , so a new mission control center would be included in the msc . 
but an even bigger facility would be needed for the mammoth rocket required for the manned lunar mission , so land acquisition was started in july 1961 for a launch operations center -lrb- loc -rrb- immediately north of canaveral at merritt island . 
the design , development and construction of the center was conducted by kurt h. debus , a member of dr. wernher von braun 's original v-2 rocket engineering team . 
debus was named the loc 's first director . 
upon kennedy 's death , president johnson issued an executive order on november 29 , 1963 , to rename the loc and cape canaveral in honor of kennedy . 
although at least three pads were planned , only two , designated a and b , were completed in october 1965 .

administrator webb realized that in order to keep apollo costs under control , he had to develop greater project management skills in his organization , so he recruited dr. george e. mueller for a high management job . 
on july 23 , 1963 , webb announced mueller 's appointment as deputy associate administrator for manned space flight , to replace then associate administrator d. brainerd holmes on his retirement effective september 1 .

under webb 's reorganization , the directors of the manned spacecraft center -lrb- gilruth -rrb- marshall space flight center -lrb- von braun -rrb- and the launch operations center -lrb- debus -rrb- effectively reported to mueller . 
based on his industry experience on air force missile projects , mueller realized some skilled managers could be found among high-ranking officers in the united states air force , so he got webb 's permission to recruit general samuel c. phillips , who gained a reputation for his effective management of the minuteman program , as omsf program controller .

mueller agreed , and phillips managed apollo from january 1964 , until it achieved the first manned landing in july 1969 , after which he returned to air force duty . 
phillips ' superior officer bernard a. schriever agreed to loan phillips to nasa , along with a staff of officers under him , on the condition that phillips be made apollo program director . 
many engineers feared that a rendezvous -- let alone a docking -- neither of which had been attempted even in earth orbit , would be extremely difficult in lunar orbit . 
in early 1961 , direct ascent was generally the mission mode in favor at nasa . 
bypassing the nasa hierarchy , he sent a series of memos and reports on the issue to associate administrator robert seamans ; while acknowledging that he spoke `` somewhat as a voice in the wilderness , '' houbolt pleaded that lor should not be discounted in studies of the question . 
seamans ' establishment of an ad-hoc committee headed by his special technical assistant nicholas e. golovin in july 1961 , to recommend a launch vehicle to be used in the apollo program , represented a turning point in nasa 's mission mode decision .

the engineers at marshall space flight center -lrb- msfc -rrb- took longer to become convinced of its merits , but their conversion was announced by wernher von braun at a briefing in june 1962 . 
kennedy 's science advisor jerome wiesner , who had expressed his opposition to manned spaceflight to kennedy before the president took office , and had opposed the decision to land men on the moon , hired golovin , who had left nasa , to chair his own `` space vehicle panel '' , ostensibly to monitor , but actually to second-guess nasa 's decisions on the saturn v launch vehicle and lor by forcing shea , seamans , and even webb to defend themselves , delaying its formal announcement to the press on july 11 , 1962 , and forcing webb to still hedge the decision as `` tentative '' .

wiesner kept up the pressure , even making the disagreement public during a two-day september visit by the president to marshall space flight center . 
wiesner blurted out `` no , that 's no good '' in front of the press , during a presentation by von braun . 
webb held firm , and issued a request for proposal to candidate lunar excursion module -lrb- lem -rrb- contractors . 
nasa announced the selection of grumman as the lem contractor in november 1962 . 
the lor method had the advantage of allowing the lander spacecraft to be used as a `` lifeboat '' in the event of a failure of the command ship . 
ironically , just such a failure happened on apollo 13 when an oxygen tank explosion left the command ship without electrical power . 
the lunar module provided propulsion , electrical power and life support to get the crew home safely . 
a 1964 msc study concluded , `` the lm -lsb- as lifeboat -rsb- ... was finally dropped , because no single reasonable csm failure could be identified that would prohibit use of the sps . '' 
maxime faget 's preliminary apollo design employed a cone-shaped command module , supported by one of several service modules providing propulsion and electrical power , sized appropriately for the space station , cislunar , and lunar landing missions . 
once kennedy 's moon landing goal became official , detailed design began of a command/service module -lrb- csm -rrb- in which the crew would spend the entire direct-ascent mission and lift off from the lunar surface for the return trip , after being soft-landed by a larger landing propulsion module . 
the final choice of lunar orbit rendezvous changed the csm 's role to the translunar ferry used to transport the crew , along with a new spacecraft , the lunar excursion module -lrb- lem , later shortened to lunar module , lm -rrb- which would take two men to the lunar surface and return them to the csm . 
the command module -lrb- cm -rrb- was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing . 
the command module -lrb- cm -rrb- was the conical crew cabin , designed to carry three astronauts from launch to lunar orbit and back to an earth ocean landing . 
its exterior was covered with an ablative heat shield , and had its own reaction control system -lrb- rcs -rrb- engines to control its attitude and steer its atmospheric entry path . 
parachutes were carried to slow its descent to splashdown . 
the module was 11.42 feet -lrb- 3.48 m -rrb- tall , 12.83 feet -lrb- 3.91 m -rrb- in diameter , and weighed approximately 12,250 pounds -lrb- 5,560 kg -rrb- . 
a cylindrical service module -lrb- sm -rrb- supported the command module , with a service propulsion engine and an rcs with propellants , and a fuel cell power generation system with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen reactants . 
a high-gain s-band antenna was used for long-distance communications on the lunar flights . 
the service module was discarded just before re-entry . 
the initial lunar flight version weighed approximately 51,300 pounds -lrb- 23,300 kg -rrb- fully fueled , while a later version designed to carry a lunar orbit scientific instrument package weighed just over 54,000 pounds -lrb- 24,000 kg -rrb- . 
on the extended lunar missions , an orbital scientific instrument package was carried . 
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa . 
because the csm design was started early before the selection of lunar orbit rendezvous , the service propulsion engine was sized to lift the csm off of the moon , and thus was oversized to about twice the thrust required for translunar flight . 
a 1964 program definition study concluded that the initial design should be continued as block i which would be used for early testing , while block ii , the actual lunar spacecraft , would incorporate the docking equipment and take advantage of the lessons learned in block i development . 
north american aviation won the contract to build the csm , and also the second stage of the saturn v launch vehicle for nasa . 
the lunar module -lrb- lm -rrb- was designed to descend from lunar orbit to land two astronauts on the moon and take them back to orbit to rendezvous with the command module . 
not designed to fly through the earth 's atmosphere or return to earth , its fuselage was designed totally without aerodynamic considerations , and was of an extremely lightweight construction . 
the initial lm model weighed approximately 33,300 pounds -lrb- 15,100 kg -rrb- , and allowed surface stays up to around 34 hours . 
an extended lunar module weighed over 36,200 pounds -lrb- 16,400 kg -rrb- , and allowed surface stays of over 3 days . 
before the apollo program began , wernher von braun and his team of rocket engineers had started work on plans for very large launch vehicles , the saturn series , and the even larger nova series . 
in the midst of these plans , von braun was transferred from the army to nasa , and made director of the marshall space flight center . 
the june 11 , 1962 , decision to use lunar orbit rendezvous enabled the saturn v to replace the nova , and the msfc proceeded to develop the saturn rocket family for apollo . 
the first four saturn i test flights were launched from lc-34 , with only live first stages , carrying dummy upper stages filled with water . 
this was followed by five launches of boilerplate csms -lrb- designated as-101 through as-105 -rrb- into orbit in 1964 and 1965 . 
the last three of these further supported the apollo program by also carrying pegasus satellites , which verified the safety of the translunar environment by measuring the frequency and severity of micrometeorite impacts .

the saturn ib was an upgraded version of the saturn i . 
the s-ib first stage increased the thrust to 1,600,000 pounds-force -lrb- 7,120 kn -rrb- , and the second stage replaced the s-iv with the s-ivb-200 , powered by a single j-2 engine burning liquid hydrogen fuel with lox , to produce 200,000 lbf -lrb- 890 kn -rrb- of thrust . 
a restartable version of the s-ivb was used as the third stage of the saturn v . 
the saturn ib could send over 40,000 pounds -lrb- 18,100 kg -rrb- into low earth orbit , sufficient for a partially fueled csm or the lm . 
the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon . 
it was 33 feet -lrb- 10.1 m -rrb- in diameter and stood 363 feet -lrb- 110.6 m -rrb- tall with its 96,800-pound -lrb- 43,900 kg -rrb- lunar payload . 
the three-stage saturn v was designed to send a fully fueled csm and lm to the moon . 
the second and third stages burned liquid hydrogen , and the third stage was a modified version of the s-ivb , with thrust increased to 230,000 lbf -lrb- 1,020 kn -rrb- and capability to restart the engine for translunar injection after reaching a parking orbit . 
the apollo astronauts were chosen from the project mercury and gemini veterans , plus from two later astronaut groups . 
all missions were commanded by gemini or mercury veterans . 
dr. harrison schmitt , a geologist , was the first nasa scientist astronaut to fly in space , and landed on the moon on the last mission , apollo 17 .

the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward . 
the crew that flew the first earth orbital test mission apollo 7 , walter m. schirra , donn eisele , and walter cunningham , were awarded the lesser nasa exceptional service medal , because of discipline problems with the flight director 's orders during their flight . 
the medals were awarded posthumously to grissom , white , and chaffee in 1969 , then to the crews of all missions from apollo 8 onward . 
two block i csms were launched from lc-34 on suborbital flights in 1966 with the saturn ib . 
the first , as-201 launched on february 26 , reached an altitude of 265.7 nautical miles -lrb- 492.1 km -rrb- and splashed down 4,577 nautical miles -lrb- 8,477 km -rrb- downrange in the atlantic ocean . 
the second , as-202 on august 25 , reached 617.1 nautical miles -lrb- 1,142.9 km -rrb- altitude and was recovered 13,900 nautical miles -lrb- 25,700 km -rrb- downrange in the pacific ocean . 
these flights validated the service module engine and the command module heat shield . 
after an unmanned lm test flight as-206 , a crew would fly the first block ii csm and lm in a dual mission known as as-207 / 208 , or as-278 -lrb- each spacecraft would be launched on a separate saturn ib . -rrb- 
the astronauts would begin wearing a new apollo spacesuit , designed to accommodate lunar extravehicular activity -lrb- eva -rrb- . 
the traditional visor helmet was replaced with a clear `` fishbowl '' type for greater visibility , and the lunar surface eva suit would include a water-cooled undergarment .

mercury/gemini veteran wally schirra , eisele , and rookie walter cunningham were announced on september 29 as the prime crew for as-205 . 
in december 1966 , the as-205 mission was canceled , since the validation of the csm would be accomplished on the 14-day first flight , and as-205 would have been devoted to space experiments and contribute no new engineering knowledge about the spacecraft . 
its saturn ib was allocated to the dual mission , now redesignated as-205 / 208 or as-258 , planned for august 1967 .

mcdivitt , scott and schweickart were promoted to the prime as-258 crew , and schirra , eisele and cunningham were reassigned as the apollo 1 backup crew . 
the problems with north american were severe enough in late 1965 to cause manned space flight administrator george mueller to appoint program director samuel phillips to head a `` tiger team '' to investigate north american 's problems and identify corrections .

meanwhile , grumman was also encountering problems with the lunar module , eliminating hopes it would be ready for manned flight in 1967 , not long after the first manned csm flights .

they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center . 
grissom , white , and chaffee decided to name their flight apollo 1 as a motivational focus on the first manned flight . 
a `` plugs-out '' test was planned for january , which would simulate a launch countdown on lc-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power . 
they trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at north american , and in the altitude chamber at the kennedy space center . 
first the crew noticed a strange odor in their spacesuits , which delayed the sealing of the hatch . 
the plugs-out test began on the morning of january 27 , 1967 , and immediately was plagued with problems . 
during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 % oxygen atmosphere . 
the astronauts were asphyxiated before the hatch could be opened . 
during this hold , an electrical fire began in the cabin , and spread quickly in the high pressure , 100 % oxygen atmosphere . 
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress . 
while the determination of responsibility for the accident was complex , the review board concluded that `` deficiencies existed in command module design , workmanship and quality control . '' 
webb also reassigned apollo spacecraft program office -lrb- aspo -rrb- manager joseph francis shea , replacing him with george low . 
nasa immediately convened an accident review board , overseen by both houses of congress . 
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials . 
to remedy the causes of the fire , changes were made in the block ii spacecraft and operational procedures , the most important of which were use of a nitrogen/oxygen mixture instead of pure oxygen before and during launch , and removal of flammable cabin and space suit materials . 
the block ii design already called for replacement of the block i plug-type hatch cover with a quick-release , outward opening door . 
nasa discontinued the manned block i program , using the block i spacecraft only for unmanned saturn v flights . 
crew members would also exclusively wear modified , fire-resistant block ii space suits , and would be designated by the block ii titles , regardless of whether a lm was present on the flight or not . 
in september 1967 , mueller approved a sequence of mission types which had to be successfully accomplished in order to achieve the manned lunar landing . 
each step had to be successfully accomplished before the next ones could be performed , and it was unknown how many tries of each mission would be necessary ; therefore letters were used instead of numbers .

the delay in the csm caused by the fire enabled nasa to catch up on man-rating the lm and saturn v. apollo 4 -lrb- as-501 -rrb- was the first unmanned flight of the saturn v , carrying a block i csm on november 9 , 1967 . 
the capability of the command module 's heat shield to survive a trans-lunar reentry was demonstrated by using the service module engine to ram it into the atmosphere at higher than the usual earth-orbital reentry speed . 
this was followed on april 4 , 1968 , by apollo 6 -lrb- as-502 -rrb- which carried a csm and a lm test article as ballast . 
based on the good performance of apollo 6 and identification of satisfactory fixes to the apollo 6 problems , nasa declared the saturn v ready to fly men , cancelling a third unmanned test . 
apollo 5 -lrb- as-204 -rrb- was the first unmanned test flight of lm in earth orbit , launched from pad 37 on january 22 , 1968 , by the saturn ib that would have been used for apollo 1 .

although grumman wanted a second unmanned test , george low decided the next lm flight would be manned . 
the lm engines were successfully test-fired and restarted , despite a computer programming error which cut short the first descent stage firing . 
the ascent engine was fired in abort mode , known as a `` fire-in-the-hole '' test , where it was lit simultaneously with jettison of the descent stage . 
apollo 8 was planned to be the d mission in december 1968 , crewed by mcdivitt , scott and schweickart , launched on a saturn v instead of two saturn ibs . 
the soviet union had sent animals around the moon on september 15 , 1968 , aboard zond 5 , and it was believed they might soon repeat the feat with human cosmonauts . 
gemini veterans frank borman and james lovell , and rookie william anders captured the world 's attention by making 10 lunar orbits in 20 hours , transmitting television pictures of the lunar surface on christmas eve , and returning safely to earth . 
rather than waste the saturn v on another simple earth-orbiting mission , aspo manager george low suggested the bold step of sending apollo 8 to orbit the moon instead , deferring the d mission to the next mission in march 1969 , and eliminating the e mission .

the g mission was achieved on apollo 11 in july 1969 by an all-gemini veteran crew consisting of neil armstrong , michael collins and buzz aldrin . 
they spent a total of 21 hours , 36 minutes on the surface , and spent 2 hours , 31 minutes outside the spacecraft , walking on the surface , taking photographs , collecting material samples , and deploying automated scientific instruments , while continuously sending black-and-white television back to earth .

the astronauts returned safely on july 24 . 
in november 1969 , gemini veteran charles `` pete '' conrad and rookie alan l. bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms . 
in november 1969 , gemini veteran charles `` pete '' conrad and rookie alan l. bean made a precision landing on apollo 12 within walking distance of the surveyor 3 unmanned lunar probe , which had landed in april 1967 on the ocean of storms . 
on one , they walked to the surveyor , photographed it , and removed some parts which they returned to earth . 
conrad and bean carried the first lunar surface color television camera , but it was damaged when accidentally pointed into the sun . 
these missions would also carry the lunar roving vehicle -lrb- lrv -rrb- increasing the exploration area and allowing televised liftoff of the lm . 
also , the block ii spacesuit was revised for the extended missions to allow greater flexibility and visibility for driving the lrv . 
nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the saturn v . 
these final missions would combine the i and j types in the 1967 list , allowing the cmp to operate a package of lunar orbital sensors and cameras while his companions were on the surface , and allowing them to stay on the moon for over three days . 
nasa publicized a preliminary list of eight more planned landing sites , with plans to increase the mass of the csm and lm for the last five missions , along with the payload capacity of the saturn v . 
but two days out , a liquid oxygen tank exploded , disabling the service module and forcing the crew to use the lm as a `` life boat '' to return to earth . 
the success of the first two landings allowed the remaining missions to be crewed with a single veteran as commander , with two rookies . 
apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added . 
apollo was grounded again , for the remainder of 1970 while the oxygen tank was redesigned and an extra one was added . 
apollo 13 launched lovell , jack swigert , and fred haise in april 1970 , headed for the fra mauro formation . 
about the time of the first landing in 1969 , it was decided to use an existing saturn v to launch the skylab orbital laboratory pre-built on the ground , replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several saturn ib launches ; this eliminated apollo 20 . 
nasa 's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing , and nasa also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming space shuttle . 
the two unused saturn vs became museum exhibits at the john f. kennedy space center on merritt island , florida , george c. marshall space center in huntsville , alabama , michoud assembly facility in new orleans , louisiana , and lyndon b. johnson space center in houston , texas . 
by 1971 , the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19 . 
the rocks collected from the moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on earth , as measured by radiometric dating techniques . 
they range in age from about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria , to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust . 
a geochemical component called kreep was discovered , which has no known terrestrial counterpart . 
one important rock found during the apollo program is dubbed the genesis rock , retrieved by astronauts david scott and james irwin during the apollo 15 mission . 
many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters , which is never seen on earth rocks , due to the thick atmosphere . 
almost all the rocks show evidence of impact process effects . 
some of the returned samples are of impact melt -lrb- materials melted near an impact crater . -rrb- 
in 2009 , nasa held a symposium on project costs which presented an estimate of the apollo program costs in 2005 dollars as roughly $ 170 billion . 
this included all research and development costs ; the procurement of 15 saturn v rockets , 16 command/service modules , 12 lunar modules , plus program support and management costs ; construction expenses for facilities and their upgrading , and costs for flight operations . 
the space review estimated in 2010 the cost of apollo from 1959 to 1973 as $ 20.4 billion , or $ 109 billion in 2010 dollars . 
the apollo extension series -lrb- apollo x , -rrb- proposed up to 30 flights to earth orbit , using the space in the spacecraft lunar module adapter -lrb- sla -rrb- to house a small orbital laboratory -lrb- workshop -rrb- . 
this study was followed by design of a larger orbital workshop to be built in orbit from an empty s-ivb saturn upper stage , and grew into the apollo applications program -lrb- aap -rrb- . 
the most ambitious plan called for using an empty s-ivb as an interplanetary spacecraft for a venus fly-by mission . 
dubbed skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v . 
dubbed skylab , it was constructed complete on the ground rather than in space , and launched in 1973 using the two lower stages of a saturn v . 
skylab 's last crew departed the station on february 8 , 1974 , and the station itself re-entered the atmosphere in 1979 , by which time it had become the oldest operational apollo-saturn component . 
it was equipped with an apollo telescope mount , the solar telescope that would have been used on the apollo telescope missions . 
in 2009 , nasa 's robotic lunar reconnaissance orbiter , while orbiting 50 kilometers -lrb- 31 mi -rrb- above the moon , began photographing the remnants of the apollo program left on the lunar surface , and photographed each site where manned apollo flights landed . 
all of the u. s. flags left on the moon during the apollo missions were found to still be standing , with the exception of the one left during the apollo 11 mission , which was blown over during that mission 's lift-off from the lunar surface and return to the mission command module in lunar orbit ; the degree to which these flags retain their original colors remains unknown .

the crew of apollo 8 sent the first live televised pictures of the earth and the moon back to earth , and read from the creation story in the book of genesis , on christmas eve , 1968 . 
an estimated one-quarter of the population of the world saw -- either live or delayed -- the christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon . 
the mission and christmas provided an inspiring end to 1968 , which had been a troubled year for the us , marked by vietnam war protests , race riots , and the assassinations of civil rights leader martin luther king , jr. , and senator robert f. kennedy .

the legislature of the european union is principally composed of the european parliament and the council of the european union , which under the treaties may establish secondary law to pursue the objective set out in the treaties .

european union law is applied by the courts of member states and the court of justice of the european union . 
where the laws of member states provide for lesser rights european union law can be enforced by the courts of member states . 
in case of european union law which should have been transposed into the laws of member states , such as directives , the european commission can take proceedings against the member state under the treaty on the functioning of the european union . 
the european court of justice is the highest court able to interpret european union law . 
supplementary sources of european union law include case law by the court of justice , international law and general principles of european union law .

the eu 's primary constitutional sources are the treaty on european union -lrb- teu -rrb- and the treaty on the functioning of the european union -lrb- tfeu -rrb- , which have been agreed or adhered to among the governments of all 28 member states . 
the european commission has the initiative to propose legislation . 
during the ordinary legislative procedure , the council -lrb- which are ministers from member state governments -rrb- and the european parliament -lrb- elected by citizens -rrb- can make amendments and must give their consent for laws to pass . 
the european court of justice is the supreme judicial body which interprets eu law , and develops it through precedent . 
the `` european council '' -lrb- rather than the council , made up of different government ministers -rrb- is composed of the prime ministers or executive presidents of the member states . 
the primary law of the eu consists mainly of the founding treaties , the `` core '' treaties being the treaty on european union -lrb- teu -rrb- and the treaty on the functioning of the european union -lrb- tfeu -rrb- . 
the teu specifically excludes certain regions , for example the faroe islands , from the jurisdiction of european union law . 
the court of justice of the european union can interpret the treaties , but it can not rule on their validity , which is subject to international law . 
individuals may rely on primary law in the court of justice of the european union if the treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear , precise and unconditional . 
treaties apply as soon as they enter into force , unless stated otherwise , and are generally concluded for an unlimited period .

the principal treaties that form the european union began with common rules for coal and steel , and then atomic energy , but more complete and formal institutions were established through the treaty of rome 1957 and the maastricht treaty 1992 -lrb- now : tfeu -rrb- .

major amending treaties were signed to complete the development of a single , internal market in the single european act 1986 , to further the development of a more social europe in the treaty of amsterdam 1997 , and to make minor amendments to the relative power of member states in the eu institutions in the treaty of nice 2001 and the treaty of lisbon 2007 .

following the nice treaty , there was an attempt to reform the constitutional law of the european union and make it more transparent ; this would have also produced a single constitutional document . 
however , as a result of the referendum in france and the referendum in the netherlands , the 2004 treaty establishing a constitution for europe never came into force . 
its substance was very similar to the proposed constitutional treaty , but it was formally an amending treaty , and -- though it significantly altered the existing treaties -- it did not completely replace them .

instead , the lisbon treaty was enacted . 
the european commission is the main executive body of the european union . 
this means that the commission has a monopoly on initiating the legislative procedure , although the council is the `` de facto catalyst of many legislative initiatives '' . 
the commission 's president -lrb- currently an ex-luxembourg prime minister , jean-claude juncker -rrb- sets the agenda for the eu 's work . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- since ireland refused to consent to changes in the treaty of lisbon 2007 , there remains one commissioner for each of the 28 member states , including the president and the high representative for foreign and security policy -lrb- currently federica mogherini -rrb- .

article 17 -lrb- 1 -rrb- of the treaty on european union states the commission should `` promote the general interest of the union '' while article 17 -lrb- 3 -rrb- adds that commissioners should be `` completely independent '' and not `` take instructions from any government '' . 
the commission 's president -lrb- currently an ex-luxembourg prime minister , jean-claude juncker -rrb- sets the agenda for the eu 's work . 
decisions are taken by a simple majority vote , usually through a `` written procedure '' of circulating the proposals and adopting if there are no objections .

this means commissioners are , through the appointment process , the unelected subordinates of member state governments . 
commissioners have sometimes been found to have abused their offices , particularly since the santer commission was censured by parliament in 1999 , and it eventually resigned due to corruption allegations . 
this resulted in one main case , commission v edith cresson where the european court of justice held that a commissioner giving her dentist a job , for which he was clearly unqualified , did in fact not break any law . 
by contrast to the ecj 's relaxed approach , a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had ` even the slightest sense of responsibility ' . 
it has a six-person board appointed by the european council , on the council 's recommendation . 
the president of the council and a commissioner can sit in on ecb meetings , but do not have voting rights .

by contrast to the ecj 's relaxed approach , a committee of independent experts found that a culture had developed where few commissioners had ` even the slightest sense of responsibility ' . 
this led to the creation of the european anti-fraud office . 
in 2012 it investigated the maltese commissioner for health , john dalli , who quickly resigned after allegations that he received a $ 60m bribe in connection with a tobacco products directive . 
while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process . 
in practice , equality and democracy are deficient because the elected representatives in the parliament can not initiate legislation against the commission 's wishes , citizens of smallest countries have ten times the voting weight in parliament as citizens of the largest countries , and `` qualified majorities '' or consensus of the council are required to legislate . 
parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote . 
it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole commission -lrb- as happened to the santer commission in 1999 -rrb- . 
however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation without the commission and council , meaning power -lrb- `` kratia '' -rrb- is not in the hands of directly elected representatives of the people -lrb- `` demos '' -rrb- : in the eu it is not yet true that `` the administration is in the hands of the many and not of the few . ''

while the commission has a monopoly on initiating legislation , the european parliament and the council of the european union have powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process . 
over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice : from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in 1979 , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process . 
parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote . 
meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines : the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition . 
the second main legislative body is the council , which is composed of different ministers of the member states . 
it meets each six months and its president -lrb- currently former poland prime minister donald tusk -rrb- is meant to ` drive forward its work ' , but it does not itself ` legislative functions ' . 
when voting takes place it is weighted inversely to member state size , so smaller member states are not dominated by larger member states . 
in total there are 352 votes , but for most acts there must be a qualified majority vote , if not consensus . 
teu article 16 -lrb- 4 -rrb- and tfeu article 238 -lrb- 3 -rrb- define this to mean at least 55 per cent of the council members -lrb- not votes -rrb- representing 65 per cent of the population of the eu : currently this means around 74 per cent , or 260 of the 352 votes .

the essence is there are three readings , starting with a commission proposal , where the parliament must vote by a majority of all meps -lrb- not just those present -rrb- to block or suggest changes , and the council must vote by qualified majority to approve changes , but by unanimity to block commission amendment .

this means , legislation can be blocked by a majority in parliament , a minority in the council , and a majority in the commission : it is harder to change eu law than stay the same . 
teu articles 4 and 5 state that powers remain with the member states unless they have been conferred , although there is a debate about the kompetenz-kompetenz question : who ultimately has the `` competence '' to define the eu 's `` competence '' . 
many member state courts believe they decide , other member state parliaments believe they decide , while within the eu , the court of justice believes it has the final say . 
to make new legislation , tfeu article 294 defines the `` ordinary legislative procedure '' that applies for most eu acts .

where the different institutions can not agree at any stage , a `` conciliation committee '' is convened , representing meps , ministers and the commission to try and get agreement on a joint text : if this works , it will be sent back to the parliament and council to approve by absolute and qualified majority . 
the judicial branch of the eu has played an important role in the development of eu law , by assuming the task of interpreting the treaties , and accelerating economic and political integration . 
today the court of justice of the european union -lrb- cjeu -rrb- is the main judicial body , within which there is a higher european court of justice -lrb- commonly abbreviated as ecj -rrb- that deals with cases that contain more public importance , and a general court that deals with issues of detail but without general importance . 
under the treaty on european union article 19 -lrb- 2 -rrb- there is one judge from each member state , 28 at present , who are supposed to `` possess the qualifications required for appointment to the highest judicial offices '' -lrb- or for the general court , the `` ability required for appointment to high judicial office '' -rrb- . 
in fact , most eu law is applied by member state courts -lrb- the english court of appeal , the german bundesgerichtshof , the belgian cour du travail , etc. -rrb- but they can refer questions to the eu court for a preliminary ruling . 
the cjeu 's duty is to `` ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed '' , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate .

a president is elected by the judges for three years . 
the cjeu 's duty is to `` ensure that in the interpretation and application of the treaties the law is observed '' , although realistically it has the ability to expand and develop the law according to the principles it deems to be appropriate . 
within the eu itself , the court of justice 's view is that if eu law conflicts with a provision of national law , then eu law has primacy . 
the italian constitutional court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962 , and the treaty was in force from 1958 , costa had no claim . 
similarly , in amministrazione delle finanze v simmenthal spa , a company , simmenthal spa , claimed that a public health inspection fee under an italian law of 1970 for importing beef from france to italy was contrary to two regulations from 1964 and 1968 . 
this has meant both the european court of justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems . 
in the first major case in 1964 , costa v enel , a milanese lawyer , and former shareholder of an energy company , named mr costa refused to pay his electricity bill to enel , as a protest against the nationalisation of the italian energy corporations . 
by contrast , the court of justice held that ultimately the treaty of rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation , and in any case under the treaty provisions only the commission could have brought a claim , not mr costa . 
generally speaking , while all member states recognise that eu law takes primacy over national law where this agreed in the treaties , they do not accept that the court of justice has the final say on foundational constitutional questions affecting democracy and human rights .

more recently the uk supreme court noted that in r -lrb- hs2 action alliance ltd -rrb- v secretary of state for transport , although the uk constitution is uncodified , there could be `` fundamental principles '' of common law , and parliament `` did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation '' of those principles when it enacted the european communities act 1972 . 
this suggests the eu 's legitimacy rests on the ultimate authority of member states , its factual commitment to human rights , and the democratic will of the people . 
the view of the german constitutional court from the solange i and solange ii decisions is that if the eu does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles -lrb- particularly democracy , the rule of law and the social state principles -rrb- then it can not override german law . 
while constitutional law concerns the european union 's governance structure , administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law . 
however , under directives , citizens or corporations were said in 1986 to not be allowed to bring claims against other non-state parties . 
all actions by eu institutions can be subject to judicial review , and judged by standards of proportionality , particularly where general principles of law , or fundamental rights are engaged . 
while constitutional law concerns the european union 's governance structure , administrative law binds eu institutions and member states to follow the law . 
in van gend en loos v nederlandse administratie der belastingen it was held that the provisions of the treaties -lrb- and eu regulations -rrb- are directly effective , if they are -lrb- 1 -rrb- clear and unambiguous -lrb- 2 -rrb- unconditional , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- did not require eu or national authorities to take further action to implement them . 
because article 30 clearly , unconditionally and immediately stated that no quantitative restrictions could be placed on trade , without a good justification , van gend en loos could recover the money it paid for the tariff . 
van gend en loos , a postal company , claimed that what is now tfeu article 30 prevented the dutch customs authorities charging tariffs , when it imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from germany to the netherlands . 
eu regulations are the same as treaty provisions in this sense , because as tfeu article 288 states , they are ` directly applicable in all member states ' . 
while the treaties and regulations will have direct effect -lrb- if clear , unconditional and immediate -rrb- , directives do not generally give citizens -lrb- as opposed to the member state -rrb- standing to sue other citizens . 
for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law . 
for example , the working time directive requires that every worker has at least 4 weeks paid holidays each year , but most member states require more than 28 days in national law . 
this view was instantly controversial , and in the early 1990s three advocate generals persuasively argued that directives should create rights and duties for all citizens . 
first , if a directive 's deadline for implementation is not met , the member state can not enforce conflicting laws , and a citizen may rely on the directive in such an action -lrb- so called `` vertical '' direct effect -rrb- . 
second , a citizen or company can invoke a directive , not just in a dispute with a public authority , but in a dispute with another citizen or company . 
ms kücükdeveci worked for 10 years , from age 18 to 28 , for swedex gmbh & co kg before her dismissal . 
in foster v british gas plc the court of justice held that mrs foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer , british gas plc , which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65 , if -lrb- 1 -rrb- pursuant to a state measure , -lrb- 2 -rrb- it provided a public service , and -lrb- 3 -rrb- had special powers .

fourth , national courts have a duty to interpret domestic law `` as far as possible in the light of the wording and purpose of the directive '' . 
in marleasing sa v la comercial sa the court of justice held that a spanish court had to interpret its general civil code provisions , on contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors , to conform with the first company law directive article 11 , that required incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons . 
so , in francovich v italy , the italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent , as the insolvency protection directive required . 
francovich , the former employee of a bankrupt venetian firm , was therefore allowed to claim 6 million lira from the italian government in damages for his loss . 
the principles of european union law are rules of law which have been developed by the european court of justice that constitute unwritten rules which are not expressly provided for in the treaties but which affect how european union law is interpreted and applies . 
accepted general principles of european union law include fundamental rights -lrb- see human rights -rrb- , proportionality , legal certainty , equality before the law and subsidiarity . 
proportionality is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1950s . 
the principle of proportionality is also recognised in article 5 of the ec treaty , stating that `` any action by the community shall not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objectives of this treaty '' . 
when there is a choice between several appropriate measures the least onerous must be adopted , and any disadvantage caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued . 
the concept of legal certainty is recognised one of the general principles of european union law by the european court of justice since the 1960s . 
it is an important general principle of international law and public law , which predates european union law . 
the adoption of laws which will have legal effect in the european union must have a proper legal basis . 
the doctrine of legitimate expectation , which has its roots in the principles of legal certainty and good faith , is also a central element of the general principle of legal certainty in european union law . 
as such the european court of justice is bound to draw inspiration from the constitutional traditions common to the member states . 
therefore , the european court of justice can not uphold measures which are incompatible with fundamental rights recognised and protected in the constitutions of member states . 
none of the original treaties establishing the european union mention protection for fundamental rights . 
at the time the only concern was that member states should be prevented from violating human rights , hence the establishment of the european convention on human rights in 1950 and the establishment of the european court of human rights .

in 1999 the european council set up a body tasked with drafting a european charter of human rights , which could form the constitutional basis for the european union and as such tailored specifically to apply to the european union and its institutions . 
the 2007 lisbon treaty explicitly recognised fundamental rights by providing in article 6 -lrb- 1 -rrb- that `` the union recognises the rights , freedoms and principles set out in the charter of fundamental rights of the european union of 7 december 2000 , as adopted at strasbourg on 12 december 2007 , which shall have the same legal value as the treaties . '' 
therefore , the charter of fundamental rights of the european union has become an integral part of european union law , codifying the fundamental rights which were previously considered general principles of european union law . 
in effect , after the lisbon treaty , the charter and the convention now co-exist under european union law , though the former is enforced by the european court of justice in relation to european union measures , and the latter by the european court of human rights in relation to measures by member states .

the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law . 
the social chapter is a chapter of the 1997 treaty of amsterdam covering social policy issues in european union law . 
the basis for the social chapter was developed in 1989 by the `` social partners '' representatives , namely unice , the employers ' confederation , the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- and ceep , the european centre of public enterprises . 
the social charter declares 30 general principles , including on fair remuneration of employment , health and safety at work , rights of disabled and elderly , the rights of workers , on vocational training and improvements of living conditions . 
the social charter became the basis for european community legislation on these issues in 40 pieces of legislation . 
the social charter was subsequently adopted in 1989 by 11 of the then 12 member states . 
the uk refused to sign the social charter and was exempt from the legislation covering social charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation . 
the uk subsequently was the only member state to veto the social charter being included as the `` social chapter '' of the 1992 maastricht treaty - instead , an agreement on social policy was added as a protocol .

today , the treaty of lisbon prohibits anti-competitive agreements in article 101 -lrb- 1 -rrb- , including price fixing . 
article 102 prohibits the abuse of dominant position , such as price discrimination and exclusive dealing . 
articles 106 and 107 provide that member state 's right to deliver public services may not be obstructed , but that otherwise public enterprises must adhere to the same competition principles as companies . 
article 102 allows the european council to regulations to govern mergers between firms -lrb- the current regulation is the regulation 139/2004/ec -rrb- . 
while the concept of a `` social market economy '' was only introduced into eu law in 2007 , free movement and trade were central to european development since the treaty of rome 1957 .

like in other regional organisations such as the north american free trade association , or the world trade organisation , breaking down barriers to trade , and enhancing free movement of goods , services , labour and capital , is meant to reduce consumer prices . 
the treaties limit free trade , to prioritise other values such as public health , consumer protection , labour rights , fair competition , and environmental improvement . 
increasingly the court of justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned by the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people 's well being . 
free movement of goods within the european union is achieved by a customs union , and the principle of non-discrimination . 
it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in france , where they bought the scotch . 
it also means states can be responsible for private actors . 
for instance , in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries , and even belgian tomato imports . 
so , in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13 , brenner autobahn , en route to italy . 
in the most famous case rewe-zentral ag v bundesmonopol für branntwein , the court of justice found that a german law requiring all spirits and liqueurs -lrb- not just imported ones -rrb- to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to tfeu article 34 , because it had a greater negative effect on imports . 
german liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol , but cassis de dijon , which rewe-zentrale ag wished to import from france , only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol . 
in a 2003 case , commission v italy italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as `` chocolate '' . 
all italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone , but british , danish and irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats . 
so , in a 2009 case , commission v italy , the court of justice held that an italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34 . 
in keck and mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a french competition law , which prevented them selling picon beer under wholesale price , was unlawful . 
the aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition , not to hinder trade . 
in konsumentombudsmannen v de agostini the court of justice reviewed swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 , and misleading commercials for skin care products . 
under the unfair commercial practices directive , the eu harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising , to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour , is misleading or aggressive , and sets out a list of examples that count as unfair . 
since its foundation , the treaties sought to enable people to pursue their life goals in any country through free movement . 
reflecting the economic nature of the project , the european community originally focused upon free movement of workers : as a `` factor of production '' . 
free movement was increasingly based on `` citizenship '' , so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active , rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights . 
for example , in steymann v staatssecretaris van justitie , a german man claimed the right to residence in the netherlands , while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the bhagwan community , which provided for everyone 's material needs irrespective of their contributions . 
the court of justice held that mr steymann was entitled to stay , so long as there was at least an `` indirect quid pro quo '' for the work he did . 
the free movement of workers regulation articles 1 to 7 set out the main provisions on equal treatment of workers . 
in a famous case , the belgian football association v bosman , a belgian footballer named jean-marc bosman claimed that he should be able to transfer from r.f.c. de liège to usl dunkerque when his contract finished , regardless of whether dunkerque could afford to pay liège the habitual transfer fees . 
in groener v minister for education the court of justice accepted that a requirement to speak gaelic to teach in a dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the irish language , but only if the measure was not disproportionate . 
in hendrix v employee insurance institute the court of justice held that a dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to belgium , because the benefit was `` closely linked to the socio-economic situation '' of the netherlands . 
conversely , in geven v land nordrhein-westfalen the court of justice held that a dutch woman living in the netherlands , but working between 3 and 14 hours a week in germany , did not have a right to receive german child benefits , even though the wife of a man who worked full-time in germany but was resident in austria could . 
citizenship of the eu has increasingly been seen as a `` fundamental '' status of member state nationals by the court of justice , and has accordingly increased the number of social services that people can access wherever they move .

in commission v austria the court held that austria was not entitled to restrict places in austrian universities to austrian students to avoid `` structural , staffing and financial problems '' if -lrb- mainly german -rrb- foreign students applied for places because there was little evidence of an actual problem . 
the court has required that higher education , along with other forms of vocational training , should be more access , albeit with qualifying periods . 
as well as creating rights for `` workers '' who generally lack bargaining power in the market , the treaty on the functioning of the european union also protects the `` freedom of establishment '' in article 49 , and `` freedom to provide services '' in article 56 . 
however , the requirements to be registered in milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory , `` justified by imperative requirements in the general interest '' and proportionately applied . 
in reyners v belgium the court of justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the belgian bar because he lacked belgian nationality was unjustified . 
tfeu article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others ' freedom of establishment when they exercise `` official authority '' , but this did an advocate 's work -lrb- as opposed to a court 's -rrb- was not official . 
by contrast in commission v italy the court of justice held that a requirement for lawyers in italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction . 
in 2006 , a toxic waste spill off the coast of côte d'ivoire , from a european ship , prompted the commission to look into legislation against toxic waste . 
with countries such as spain not even having a crime against shipping toxic waste , franco frattini , the justice , freedom and security commissioner , proposed with dimas to create criminal sentences for `` ecological crimes '' . 
however , in october 2007 , the court of justice ruled that the commission could not propose what the criminal sanctions could be , only that there must be some . 
the competence for the union to do this was contested in 2005 at the court of justice resulting in a victory for the commission . 
the `` freedom to provide services '' under tfeu article 56 applies to people who give services `` for remuneration '' , especially commercial or professional activity . 
for example , in van binsbergen v bestuur van de bedrijfvereniging voor de metaalnijverheid a dutch lawyer moved to belgium while advising a client in a social security case , and was told he could not continue because dutch law said only people established in the netherlands could give legal advice . 
the court of justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states , and so this differed from other cases where prostitution or other quasi-legal activity was subject to restriction . 
the dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary , so she argued this restricted the freedom -lrb- of the german health clinic -rrb- to provide services . 
this meant the daily mail newspaper 's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the netherlands without first settling its tax bills in the uk . 
uk law only required # 1 of capital to start a company , while denmark 's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 danish krone -lrb- around $ 27,000 -rrb- to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent .

although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection , labour rights to participate in work , or the public interest in collecting taxes , denial of capacity went too far : it was an `` outright negation '' of the right of establishment . 
similarly in überseering bv v nordic construction gmbh the court of justice held that a german court could not deny a dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in germany . 
the amazon rainforest -lrb- portuguese : floresta amazônica or amazônia ; spanish : selva amazónica , amazonía or usually amazonia ; french : forêt amazonienne ; dutch : amazoneregenwoud -rrb- , also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle , is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america . 
this basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres -lrb- 2,700,000 sq mi -rrb- , of which 5,500,000 square kilometres -lrb- 2,100,000 sq mi -rrb- are covered by the rainforest . 
this region includes territory belonging to nine nations . 
states or departments in four nations contain `` amazonas '' in their names . 
the amazon represents over half of the planet 's remaining rainforests , and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world , with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species .

following the cretaceous -- paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . 
climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics . 
during the oligocene , for example , the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band . 
it expanded again during the middle miocene , then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum . 
however , the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods , allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species . 
following the cretaceous -- paleogene extinction event , the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent . 
from 66 -- 34 mya , the rainforest extended as far south as 45 ° .

during the mid-eocene , it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch . 
water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic , while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin . 
as the andes mountains rose , however , a large basin was created that enclosed a lake ; now known as the solimões basin . 
within the last 5 -- 10 million years , this accumulating water broke through the purus arch , joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic .

there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum -lrb- lgm -rrb- and subsequent deglaciation . 
analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present , and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin . 
some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small , isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland ; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north , south , and east than is seen today . 
this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin , and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data .

archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea , as described in her book amazonia : man and culture in a counterfeit paradise . 
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre -lrb- 0.52 / sq mi -rrb- is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population . 
she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre -lrb- 0.52 / sq mi -rrb- is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting , with agriculture needed to host a larger population . 
however , recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated . 
some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500 , divided between dense coastal settlements , such as that at marajó , and inland dwellers . 
for a long time , it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated , as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil .

by 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000 . 
the first european to travel the length of the amazon river was francisco de orellana in 1542 . 
the bbc 's unnatural histories presents evidence that orellana , rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought , was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the amazon in the 1540s . 
it is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from europe , such as smallpox . 
since the 1970s , numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between ad 0 -- 1250 , furthering claims about pre-columbian civilizations .

the bbc 's unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest , rather than being a pristine wilderness , has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta . 
terra preta -lrb- black earth -rrb- , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management . 
terra preta -lrb- black earth -rrb- , which is distributed over large areas in the amazon forest , is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management . 
the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment ; meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management , rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed . 
in the region of the xingu tribe , remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida .

various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh . 
vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus . 
deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas . 
prior to the early 1960s , access to the forest 's interior was highly restricted , and the forest remained basically intact . 
farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method . 
however , the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion . 
deforestation is considerable , and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space . 
between 1991 and 2000 , the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres -lrb- 160,000 to 227,000 sq mi -rrb- , with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle .

currently , brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the united states . 
seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon , and 91 % of land deforested since 1970 , is used for livestock pasture . 
the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon . 
the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation . 
the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005 -lrb- 22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year -rrb- was 18 % higher than in the previous five years -lrb- 19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year -rrb- . 
although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014 , there has been an increase to the present day .

the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar -lrb- sar -rrb- and thematic mapper -lrb- tm -rrb- to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications . 
in 2005 , parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years , and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought . 
scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response , coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate , are pushing the rainforest towards a `` tipping point '' where it would irreversibly start to die .

it concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert , with catastrophic consequences for the world 's climate . 
a july 23 , 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought . 
in 2010 the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought , in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought . 
the affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles -lrb- 3,000,000 km2 -rrb- of rainforest , compared to 734,000 square miles -lrb- 1,900,000 km2 -rrb- in 2005 .

a recent molecular phylogenetics analysis concluded that the common ancestor of all modern ctenophores was cydippid-like , and that all the modern groups appeared relatively recently , probably after the cretaceous -- paleogene extinction event 66 million years ago . 
evidence accumulating since the 1980s indicates that the `` cydippids '' are not monophyletic , in other words do not include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids . 
despite their soft , gelatinous bodies , fossils thought to represent ctenophores , apparently with no tentacles but many more comb-rows than modern forms , have been found in lagerstätten as far back as the early cambrian , about 515 million years ago .

like sponges and cnidarians , ctenophores have two main layers of cells that sandwich a middle layer of jelly-like material , which is called the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores ; more complex animals have three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer . 
hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic , along with sponges .

ranging from about 1 millimeter -lrb- 0.039 in -rrb- to 1.5 meters -lrb- 4.9 ft -rrb- in size , ctenophores are the largest non-colonial animals that use cilia -lrb- `` hairs '' -rrb- as their main method of locomotion .

most species have eight strips , called comb rows , that run the length of their bodies and bear comb-like bands of cilia , called `` ctenes , '' stacked along the comb rows so that when the cilia beat , those of each comb touch the comb below . 
the name `` ctenophora '' means `` comb-bearing '' , from the greek κτείς -lrb- stem-form κτεν - -rrb- meaning `` comb '' and the greek suffix - φορος meaning `` carrying '' . 
at least two textbooks base their descriptions of ctenophores on the cydippid pleurobrachia . 
coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study . 
coastal species need to be tough enough to withstand waves and swirling sediment particles , while some oceanic species are so fragile that it is very difficult to capture them intact for study . 
hence most attention has until recently concentrated on three coastal genera -- pleurobrachia , beroe and mnemiopsis . 
the inner surface of the cavity is lined with an epithelium , the gastrodermis . 
the nearer side is composed of tall nutritive cells that store nutrients in vacuoles -lrb- internal compartments -rrb- , germ cells that produce eggs or sperm , and photocytes that produce bioluminescence . 
the internal cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; a pharynx -lrb- `` throat '' -rrb- ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach ; and a system of internal canals . 
the internal cavity forms : a mouth that can usually be closed by muscles ; a pharynx -lrb- `` throat '' -rrb- ; a wider area in the center that acts as a stomach ; and a system of internal canals . 
these branch through the mesoglea to the most active parts of the animal : the mouth and pharynx ; the roots of the tentacles , if present ; all along the underside of each comb row ; and four branches round the sensory complex at the far end from the mouth -- two of these four branches terminate in anal pores . 
the outer surface bears usually eight comb rows , called swimming-plates , which are used for swimming . 
the `` combs '' -lrb- also called `` ctenes '' or `` comb plates '' -rrb- run across each row , and each consists of thousands of unusually long cilia , up to 2 millimeters -lrb- 0.079 in -rrb- . 
unlike conventional cilia and flagella , which has a filament structure arranged in a 9 + 2 pattern , these cilia are arranged in a 9 + 3 pattern , where the extra compact filament is suspected to have a supporting function . 
hence ctenophores usually swim in the direction in which the mouth is pointing , unlike jellyfish .

it is uncertain how ctenophores control their buoyancy , but experiments have shown that some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities . 
if they enter less dense brackish water , the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density , to avoid sinking .

conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater , the rosettes may pump water out of the mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density . 
the largest single sensory feature is the aboral organ -lrb- at the opposite end from the mouth -rrb- .

the statocyst is protected by a transparent dome made of long , immobile cilia . 
its main component is a statocyst , a balance sensor consisting of a statolith , a solid particle supported on four bundles of cilia , called `` balancers '' , that sense its orientation .

cydippid ctenophores have bodies that are more or less rounded , sometimes nearly spherical and other times more cylindrical or egg-shaped ; the common coastal `` sea gooseberry , '' pleurobrachia , sometimes has an egg-shaped body with the mouth at the narrow end , although some individuals are more uniformly round . 
from opposite sides of the body extends a pair of long , slender tentacles , each housed in a sheath into which it can be withdrawn .

the tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are typically fringed with tentilla -lrb- `` little tentacles '' -rrb- , although a few genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches . 
colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles -lrb- chambers -rrb- that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk . 
the tentilla of euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids : they contain striated muscle , a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum ctenophora ; and they are coiled when relaxed , while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed . 
euplokamis ' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey : they may flick out very quickly -lrb- in 40 to 60 milliseconds -rrb- ; they can wriggle , which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms ; and they coil round prey .

from each balancer in the statocyst a ciliary groove runs out under the dome and then splits to connect with two adjacent comb rows , and in some species runs all the way along the comb rows . 
the lobata have a pair of lobes , which are muscular , cuplike extensions of the body that project beyond the mouth . 
between the lobes on either side of the mouth , many species of lobates have four auricles , gelatinous projections edged with cilia that produce water currents that help direct microscopic prey toward the mouth .

this combination of structures enables lobates to feed continuously on suspended planktonic prey . 
members of the lobate genera bathocyroe and ocyropsis can escape from danger by clapping their lobes , so that the jet of expelled water drives them backwards very quickly .

unlike cydippids , the movements of lobates ' combs are coordinated by nerves rather than by water disturbances created by the cilia , yet combs on the same row beat in the same mexican wave style as the mechanically coordinated comb rows of cydippids and beroids .

in front of the field of macrocilia , on the mouth `` lips '' in some species of beroe , is a pair of narrow strips of adhesive epithelial cells on the stomach wall that `` zip '' the mouth shut when the animal is not feeding , by forming intercellular connections with the opposite adhesive strip .

the cestida -lrb- `` belt animals '' -rrb- are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . 
there are two known species , with worldwide distribution in warm , and warm-temperate waters : cestum veneris -lrb- `` venus ' girdle '' -rrb- is among the largest ctenophores -- up to 1.5 meters -lrb- 4.9 ft -rrb- long , and can undulate slowly or quite rapidly . 
the cestida -lrb- `` belt animals '' -rrb- are ribbon-shaped planktonic animals , with the mouth and aboral organ aligned in the middle of opposite edges of the ribbon . 
cestids can swim by undulating their bodies as well as by the beating of their comb-rows . 
velamen parallelum , which is typically less than 20 centimeters -lrb- 0.66 ft -rrb- long , can move much faster in what has been described as a `` darting motion '' . 
most platyctenida have oval bodies that are flattened in the oral-aboral direction , with a pair of tentilla-bearing tentacles on the aboral surface . 
they cling to and creep on surfaces by everting the pharynx and using it as a muscular `` foot '' . 
all but one of the known platyctenid species lack comb-rows . 
platyctenids are usually cryptically colored , live on rocks , algae , or the body surfaces of other invertebrates , and are often revealed by their long tentacles with many sidebranches , seen streaming off the back of the ctenophore into the current . 
the gonads are located in the parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows , and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis . 
fertilization is external in most species , but platyctenids use internal fertilization and keep the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch . 
self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus mnemiopsis , and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile .

in the genus beroe the juveniles , like the adults , lack tentacles and tentacle sheaths . 
in some groups , such as the flat , bottom-dwelling platyctenids , the juveniles behave more like true larvae , as they live among the plankton and thus occupy a different ecological niche from their parents and attain the adult form by a more radical metamorphosis , after dropping to the sea-floor .

juveniles will luminesce more brightly in relation to their body size than adults , whose luminescence is diffused over their bodies . 
almost all ctenophores are predators -- there are no vegetarians and only one genus that is partly parasitic . 
members of the genus haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incorporate their prey 's nematocysts -lrb- stinging cells -rrb- into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts .

members of the cydippid genus pleurobrachia and the lobate bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey : pleurobrachia 's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods , while bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller , weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae . 
the two-tentacled `` cydippid '' lampea feeds exclusively on salps , close relatives of sea-squirts that form large chain-like floating colonies , and juveniles of lampea attach themselves like parasites to salps that are too large for them to swallow . 
ctenophores used to be regarded as `` dead ends '' in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals . 
detailed investigation of chum salmon , oncorhynchus keta , showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps , and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around . 
beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores . 
this is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the red sea . 
some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores , and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations . 
on the other hand , in the late 1980s the western atlantic ctenophore mnemiopsis leidyi was accidentally introduced into the black sea and sea of azov via the ballast tanks of ships , and has been blamed for causing sharp drops in fish catches by eating both fish larvae and small crustaceans that would otherwise feed the adult fish .

mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the mnemiopsis-eating north american ctenophore beroe ovata , and by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993 , which significantly slowed the animal 's metabolism .

because of their soft , gelatinous bodies , ctenophores are extremely rare as fossils , and fossils that have been interpreted as ctenophores have been found only in lagerstätten , places where the environment was exceptionally suited to preservation of soft tissue . 
the ediacaran eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly . 
three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid-cambrian period . 
three additional putative species were then found in the burgess shale and other canadian rocks of similar age , about 505 million years ago in the mid-cambrian period . 
all three apparently lacked tentacles but had between 24 and 80 comb rows , far more than the 8 typical of living species .

they suggested that stromatoveris was an evolutionary `` aunt '' of ctenophores , and that ctenophores originated from sessile animals whose descendants became swimmers and changed the cilia from a feeding mechanism to a propulsion system .

several more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals . 
however , other researchers have argued that the placement of ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes , and that porifera -lrb- sponges -rrb- is the earliest-diverging animal phylum instead . 
since all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid-like larvae , it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor also resembled cydippids , having an egg-shaped body and a pair of retractable tentacles . 
a molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001 , using 26 species , including 4 recently discovered ones , confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like . 
this suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was relatively recent , and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the cretaceous -- paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished . 
richard harbison 's purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic , in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid .

many millerton residents , drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding , moved to the new community . 
fresno became an incorporated city in 1885 . 
by 1931 the fresno traction company operated 47 streetcars over 49 miles of track . 
soon there was a store around the station and the store grew the town of fresno station , later called fresno .

fulton street in downtown fresno was fresno 's main financial and commercial district before being converted into one of the nation 's first pedestrian malls in 1964 . 
renamed the fulton mall , the area contains the densest collection of historic buildings in fresno . 
while the fulton mall corridor has suffered a sharp decline from its heyday , the mall includes some of the finest public art pieces in the country , including the only pierre-auguste renoir piece in the world that one can walk up to and touch . 
the public art pieces will be restored and placed near their current locations and will feature wide sidewalks -lrb- up to 28 ' on the east side of the street -rrb- to continue with the pedestrian friendly environment of the district .

the popular neighborhood known as the tower district is centered around the historic tower theatre , which is included on the national list of historic places . 
the theater was built in 1939 and is at olive and wishon avenues in the heart of the tower district . 
-lrb- the name of the theater refers to a well-known landmark water tower , which is actually in another nearby area -rrb- . 
to some extent , the businesses of the tower district were developed due to the proximity of the original fresno normal school , -lrb- later renamed california state university at fresno -rrb- . 
in 1916 the college moved to what is now the site of fresno city college one-half mile north of the tower district .

the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades . 
the area includes many california bungalow and american craftsman style homes , spanish colonial revival style architecture , mediterranean revival style architecture , mission revival style architecture , and many storybook houses designed by fresno architects , hilliard , taylor & wheeler . 
the residential architecture of the tower district contrasts with the newer areas of tract homes urban sprawl in north and east areas of fresno . 
the area is also known for its early twentieth century homes , many of which have been restored in recent decades . 
the section of huntington boulevard between first street on the west to cedar avenue on the east is the home to many large , stately homes . 
the alta vista tract , as the land would become known , was mapped by william stranahan for the pacific improvement corporation , and was officially platted in 1911 . 
in 1914 developers billings & meyering acquired the tract , completed street development , provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service , and began marketing the property with fervor . 
a mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes . 
this rapid development was no doubt hastened by the fresno traction company right-of-way along huntington boulevard , which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the county hospital . 
the `` west side '' of fresno , also often called `` southwest fresno '' , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city . 
the neighborhood lies southwest of the 99 freeway -lrb- which divides it from downtown fresno -rrb- , west of the 41 freeway and south of nielsen ave -lrb- or the newly constructed 180 freeway -rrb- , and extends to the city limits to the west and south . 
the neighborhood is traditionally considered to be the center of fresno 's african-american community . 
it is culturally diverse and also includes significant mexican-american and asian-american -lrb- principally hmong or laotian -rrb- populations . 
the `` west side '' of fresno , also often called `` southwest fresno '' , is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city . 
the neighborhood includes kearney boulevard , named after early 20th century entrepreneur and millionaire m. theo kearney , which extends from fresno street in southwest fresno about 20 mi -lrb- 32 km -rrb- west to kerman , california . 
a small , two-lane rural road for most of its length , kearney boulevard is lined with tall palm trees . 
the roughly half-mile stretch of kearney boulevard between fresno street and thorne ave was at one time the preferred neighborhood for fresno 's elite african-american families . 
another section , brookhaven , on the southern edge of the west side south of jensen and west of elm , was given the name by the fresno city council in an effort to revitalize the neighborhood 's image . 
the isolated subdivision was for years known as the `` dogg pound '' in reference to a local gang , and as of late 2008 was still known for high levels of violent crime . 
while many homes in the neighborhood date back to the 1930s or before , the neighborhood is also home to several public housing developments built between the 1960s and 1990s by the fresno housing authority . 
there have been numerous attempts to revitalize the neighborhood , including the construction of a modern shopping center on the corner of fresno and b streets , an aborted attempt to build luxury homes and a golf course on the western edge of the neighborhood , and some new section 8 apartments have been built along church ave west of elm st. cargill meat solutions and foster farms both have large processing facilities in the neighborhood , and the stench from these -lrb- and other small industrial facilities -rrb- has long plagued area residents .

in the north eastern part of fresno , woodward park was founded by the late ralph woodward , a long-time fresno resident . 
the initial 235 acres -lrb- 0.95 km2 -rrb- , combined with additional acres acquired later by the city , brings the park to a sizable 300 acres -lrb- 1.2 km2 -rrb- . 
the park has a multi-use amphitheatre that seats up to 2,500 people , authentic japanese garden , fenced dog park , two-mile -lrb- 3 km -rrb- equestrian trail , exercise par course , three children 's playgrounds , a lake , 3 small ponds , 7 picnic areas and five miles -lrb- 8 km -rrb- of multipurpose trails that are part of the san joaquin river parkway 's lewis s. eaton trail . 
when complete , the lewis s. eaton trail system will cover 22 miles -lrb- 35 km -rrb- between highway 99 and friant dam . 
the park is open april through october , 6am to 10pm and november through march , 6am to 7pm . 
formed in 1946 , sierra sky park airport is a residential airport community born of a unique agreement in transportation law to allow personal aircraft and automobiles to share certain roads . 
developer william smilie created the nation 's first planned aviation community . 
sierra sky park was the first aviation community to be built -lsb- citation needed -rsb- and there are now numerous such communities across the united states and around the world .

fresno is marked by a semi-arid climate -lrb- köppen bsh -rrb- , with mild , moist winters and hot and dry summers , thus displaying mediterranean characteristics . 
july is the warmest month , averaging 83.0 °f -lrb- 28.3 °c -rrb- ; normally , there are 32 days of 100 °f -lrb- 37.8 °c -rrb- + highs and 106 days of 90 °f -lrb- 32.2 °c -rrb- + highs , and in july and august , there are only three or four days where the high does not reach 90 °f -lrb- 32.2 °c -rrb- . 
average annual precipitation is around 11.5 inches -lrb- 292.1 mm -rrb- , which , by definition , would classify the area as a semidesert . 
most of the wind rose direction occurrences derive from the northwest , as winds are driven downward along the axis of the california central valley ; in december , january and february there is an increased presence of southeastern wind directions in the wind rose statistics .

to avoid interference with existing vhf television stations in the san francisco bay area and those planned for chico , sacramento , salinas , and stockton , the federal communications commission decided that fresno would only have uhf television stations . 
the very first fresno television station to begin broadcasting was kmj-tv , which debuted on june 1 , 1953 .

fresno is served by state route 99 , the main north/south freeway that connects the major population centers of the california central valley . 
state route 168 , the sierra freeway , heads east to the city of clovis and huntington lake . 
state route 41 -lrb- yosemite freeway/eisenhower freeway -rrb- comes into fresno from atascadero in the south , and then heads north to yosemite . 
state route 180 -lrb- kings canyon freeway -rrb- comes from the west via mendota , and from the east in kings canyon national park going towards the city of reedley . 
fresno is the largest u.s. city not directly linked to an interstate highway . 
when the interstate highway system was created in the 1950s , the decision was made to build what is now interstate 5 on the west side of the central valley , and thus bypass many of the population centers in the region , instead of upgrading what is now state route 99 . 
due to rapidly raising population and traffic in cities along sr 99 , as well as the desirability of federal funding , much discussion has been made to upgrade it to interstate standards and eventually incorporate it into the interstate system , most likely as interstate 9 .

this concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth , largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the bell system . 
davies is credited with coining the modern name packet switching and inspiring numerous packet switching networks in europe in the decade following , including the incorporation of the concept in the early arpanet in the united states .

packet switching contrasts with another principal networking paradigm , circuit switching , a method which pre-allocates dedicated network bandwidth specifically for each communication session , each having a constant bit rate and latency between nodes . 
in cases of billable services , such as cellular communication services , circuit switching is characterized by a fee per unit of connection time , even when no data is transferred , while packet switching may be characterized by a fee per unit of information transmitted , such as characters , packets , or messages .

packet mode communication may be implemented with or without intermediate forwarding nodes -lrb- packet switches or routers -rrb- . 
packets are normally forwarded by intermediate network nodes asynchronously using first-in , first-out buffering , but may be forwarded according to some scheduling discipline for fair queuing , traffic shaping , or for differentiated or guaranteed quality of service , such as weighted fair queuing or leaky bucket . 
in case of a shared physical medium -lrb- such as radio or 10base5 -rrb- , the packets may be delivered according to a multiple access scheme .

in connectionless mode each packet includes complete addressing information . 
the packets are routed individually , sometimes resulting in different paths and out-of-order delivery . 
each packet is labeled with a destination address , source address , and port numbers . 
at the destination , the original message/data is reassembled in the correct order , based on the packet sequence number . 
the packet header can be small , as it only needs to contain this code and any information , such as length , timestamp , or sequence number , which is different for different packets . 
routing a packet requires the node to look up the connection id in a table . 
the packets include a connection identifier rather than address information and are negotiated between endpoints so that they are delivered in order and with error checking . 
connection-oriented transmission requires a setup phase in each involved node before any packet is transferred to establish the parameters of communication . 
both x. 25 and frame relay provide connection-oriented operations . 
however , x. 25 and well as frame relay have been supplanted by the internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- at the network layer , and the asynchronous transfer mode -lrb- atm -rrb- and or versions of multi-protocol label switching -lrb- mpls -rrb- at layer two . 
for a while , frame relay was used to interconnect lans across wide area networks . 
a typical configuration is to run ip over atm or a version of mpls . 
arpanet and sita hln became operational in 1969 . 
two fundamental differences involved the division of functions and tasks between the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core . 
in the virtual call system , the network guarantees sequenced delivery of data to the host . 
the user datagram protocol -lrb- udp -rrb- is an example of a datagram protocol . 
appletalk was a proprietary suite of networking protocols developed by apple inc. in 1985 for apple macintosh computers . 
appletalk included features that allowed local area networks to be established ad hoc without the requirement for a centralized router or server . 
the appletalk system automatically assigned addresses , updated the distributed namespace , and configured any required inter-network routing . 
it was a plug-n-play system . 
the cyclades packet switching network was a french research network designed and directed by louis pouzin . 
it was the first network to make the hosts responsible for reliable delivery of data , rather than the network itself , using unreliable datagrams and associated end-to-end protocol mechanisms .

initially built with three layers , it later -lrb- 1982 -rrb- evolved into a seven-layer osi-compliant networking protocol . 
however , decnet phase ii -lrb- and later -rrb- were open standards with published specifications , and several implementations were developed outside dec , including one for linux . 
in 1965 , at the instigation of warner sinback , a data network based on this voice-phone network was designed to connect ge 's four computer sales and service centers -lrb- schenectady , phoenix , chicago , and phoenix -rrb- to facilitate a computer time-sharing service , apparently the world 's first commercial online service .

they lost money from the beginning , and sinback , a high-level marketing manager , was given the job of turning the business around . 
he decided that a time-sharing system , based on kemney 's work at dartmouth -- which used a computer on loan from ge -- could be profitable . 
merit network , inc. , an independent non-profit 501 -lrb- c -rrb- -lrb- 3 -rrb- corporation governed by michigan 's public universities , was formed in 1966 as the michigan educational research information triad to explore computer networking between three of michigan 's public universities as a means to help the state 's educational and economic development . 
with initial support from the state of michigan and the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- , the packet-switched network was first demonstrated in december 1971 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the ibm mainframe computer systems at the university of michigan in ann arbor and wayne state university in detroit . 
over the next several years in addition to host to host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terminal to host connections , host to host batch connections -lrb- remote job submission , remote printing , batch file transfer -rrb- , interactive file transfer , gateways to the tymnet and telenet public data networks , x. 25 host attachments , gateways to x. 25 data networks , ethernet attached hosts , and eventually tcp/ip and additional public universities in michigan join the network . 
telenet was the first fcc-licensed public data network in the united states . 
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public . 
it was founded by former arpa ipto director larry roberts as a means of making arpanet technology public . 
it initially used arpanet technology but changed the host interface to x. 25 and the terminal interface to x. 29 . 
telenet was incorporated in 1973 and started operations in 1975 . 
tymnet was an international data communications network headquartered in san jose , ca that utilized virtual call packet switched technology and used x. 25 , sna/sdlc , bsc and ascii interfaces to connect host computers -lrb- servers -rrb- at thousands of large companies , educational institutions , and government agencies .

users typically connected via dial-up connections or dedicated async connections . 
the business consisted of a large public network that supported dial-up users and a private network business that allowed government agencies and large companies -lrb- mostly banks and airlines -rrb- to build their own dedicated networks . 
the private networks were often connected via gateways to the public network to reach locations not on the private network . 
there were two kinds of x. 25 networks . 
datapac was developed by bell northern research which was a joint venture of bell canada -lrb- a common carrier -rrb- and northern telecom -lrb- a telecommunications equipment supplier -rrb- . 
a user or host could call a host on a foreign network by including the dnic of the remote network as part of the destination address . 
austpac was an australian public x. 25 network operated by telstra . 
started by telecom australia in the early 1980s , austpac was australia 's first public packet-switched data network , supporting applications such as on-line betting , financial applications -- the australian tax office made use of austpac -- and remote terminal access to academic institutions , who maintained their connections to austpac up until the mid-late 1990s in some cases . 
access can be via a dial-up terminal to a pad , or , by linking a permanent x. 25 node to the network . 
datanet 1 was the public switched data network operated by the dutch ptt telecom -lrb- now known as kpn -rrb- . 
strictly speaking datanet 1 only referred to the network and the connected users via leased lines -lrb- using the x. 121 dnic 2041 -rrb- , the name also referred to the public pad service telepad -lrb- using the dnic 2049 -rrb- .

although this use of the name was incorrect all these services were managed by the same people within one department of kpn contributed to the confusion . 
the computer science network -lrb- csnet -rrb- was a computer network funded by the u.s. national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- that began operation in 1981 . 
its purpose was to extend networking benefits , for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to arpanet , due to funding or authorization limitations . 
it played a significant role in spreading awareness of , and access to , national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global internet . 
internet2 is a not-for-profit united states computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities , industry , and government . 
the internet2 community , in partnership with qwest , built the first internet2 network , called abilene , in 1998 and was a prime investor in the national lambdarail -lrb- nlr -rrb- project .

in 2006 , internet2 announced a partnership with level 3 communications to launch a brand new nationwide network , boosting its capacity from 10 gbit/s to 100 gbit/s . 
in october , 2007 , internet2 officially retired abilene and now refers to its new , higher capacity network as the internet2 network . 
the national science foundation network -lrb- nsfnet -rrb- was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the united states . 
the national science foundation network -lrb- nsfnet -rrb- was a program of coordinated , evolving projects sponsored by the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- beginning in 1985 to promote advanced research and education networking in the united states . 
initially created to link researchers to the nation 's nsf-funded supercomputing centers , through further public funding and private industry partnerships it developed into a major part of the internet backbone . 
the very high-speed backbone network service -lrb- vbns -rrb- came on line in april 1995 as part of a national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- sponsored project to provide high-speed interconnection between nsf-sponsored supercomputing centers and select access points in the united states .

the network was engineered and operated by mci telecommunications under a cooperative agreement with the nsf . 
by 1998 , the vbns had grown to connect more than 100 universities and research and engineering institutions via 12 national points of presence with ds-3 -lrb- 45 mbit/s -rrb- , oc-3c -lrb- 155 mbit/s -rrb- , and oc-12c -lrb- 622 mbit/s -rrb- links on an all oc-12c backbone , a substantial engineering feat for that time . 
the vbns installed one of the first ever production oc-48c -lrb- 2.5 gbit/s -rrb- ip links in february 1999 and went on to upgrade the entire backbone to oc-48c . 
the black death is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central asia , where it then travelled along the silk road , reaching crimea by 1343 . 
from there , it was most likely carried by oriental rat fleas living on the black rats that were regular passengers on merchant ships . 
spreading throughout the mediterranean and europe , the black death is estimated to have killed 30 -- 60 % of europe 's total population . 
the world population as a whole did not recover to pre-plague levels until the 17th century . 
the plague recurred occasionally in europe until the 19th century . 
the plague disease , caused by yersinia pestis , is enzootic -lrb- commonly present -rrb- in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents , including marmots , in various areas including central asia , kurdistan , western asia , northern india and uganda . 
nestorian graves dating to 1338 -- 39 near lake issyk kul in kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic , from which it could easily have spread to china and india . 
in october 2010 , medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in china . 
in the 1330s a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine , starting in 1331 , with a deadly plague arriving soon after . 
epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25 million chinese and other asians during the 15 years before it reached constantinople in 1347 . 
plague was reportedly first introduced to europe via genoese traders at the port city of kaffa in the crimea in 1347 . 
after a protracted siege , during which the mongol army under jani beg was suffering from the disease , the army catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls of kaffa to infect the inhabitants .

the genoese traders fled , taking the plague by ship into sicily and the south of europe , whence it spread north . 
whether or not this hypothesis is accurate , it is clear that several existing conditions such as war , famine , and weather contributed to the severity of the black death . 
from italy , the disease spread northwest across europe , striking france , spain , portugal and england by june 1348 , then turned and spread east through germany and scandinavia from 1348 to 1350 . 
finally it spread to northwestern russia in 1351 . 
the plague was somewhat less common in parts of europe that had smaller trade relations with their neighbours , including the kingdom of poland , the majority of the basque country , isolated parts of belgium and the netherlands , and isolated alpine villages throughout the continent .

it was introduced in norway in 1349 when a ship landed at askøy , then spread to bjørgvin -lrb- modern bergen -rrb- and iceland . 
the plague struck various countries in the middle east during the pandemic , leading to serious depopulation and permanent change in both economic and social structures . 
by autumn 1347 , the plague reached alexandria in egypt , probably through the port 's trade with constantinople , and ports on the black sea .

the city 's residents fled to the north , most of them dying during the journey , but the infection had been spread to the people of asia minor . 
gasquet -lrb- 1908 -rrb- claimed that the latin name atra mors -lrb- black death -rrb- for the 14th-century epidemic first appeared in modern times in 1631 in a book on danish history by j.i. pontanus : `` vulgo & ab effectu atram mortem vocatibant .

in england , it was not until 1823 that the medieval epidemic was first called the black death . 
the name spread through scandinavia and then germany , gradually becoming attached to the mid 14th-century epidemic as a proper name . 
the most authoritative account at the time came from the medical faculty in paris in a report to the king of france that blamed the heavens , in the form of a conjunction of three planets in 1345 that caused a `` great pestilence in the air '' .

that the plague was caused by bad air became the most widely accepted theory . 
today , this is known as the miasma theory . 
the dominant explanation for the black death is the plague theory , which attributes the outbreak to yersinia pestis , also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern china in 1865 , eventually spreading to india . 
the investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited hong kong in 1894 , among whom was the french-swiss bacteriologist alexandre yersin , after whom the pathogen was named yersinia pestis .

the mechanism by which y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by paul-louis simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host . 
the bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents : one resistant to the disease , which act as hosts , keeping the disease endemic , and a second that lack resistance . 
the historian francis aidan gasquet wrote about the ` great pestilence ' in 1893 and suggested that `` it would appear to be some form of the ordinary eastern or bubonic plague '' .

he was able to adopt the epidemiology of the bubonic plague for the black death for the second edition in 1908 , implicating rats and fleas in the process , and his interpretation was widely accepted for other ancient and medieval epidemics , such as the justinian plague that was prevalent in the eastern roman empire from 541 to 700 ce .

the modern bubonic plague has a mortality rate of 30 -- 75 % and symptoms including fever of 38 -- 41 °c -lrb- 100 -- 106 °f -rrb- , headaches , painful aching joints , nausea and vomiting , and a general feeling of malaise .

left untreated , of those that contract the bubonic plague , 80 percent die within eight days . 
pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 percent . 
symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches -lrb- purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation -rrb- . 
in october 2010 , the open-access scientific journal plos pathogens published a paper by a multinational team who undertook a new investigation into the role of yersinia pestis in the black death following the disputed identification by drancourt and raoult in 1998 .

the authors concluded that this new research , together with prior analyses from the south of france and germany , '' ... ends the debate about the etiology of the black death , and unambiguously demonstrates that y. pestis was the causative agent of the epidemic plague that devastated europe during the middle ages '' . 
the study also found that there were two previously unknown but related clades -lrb- genetic branches -rrb- of the y. pestis genome associated with medieval mass graves . 
these clades -lrb- which are thought to be extinct -rrb- were found to be ancestral to modern isolates of the modern y. pestis strains y. p. orientalis and y. p. medievalis , suggesting the plague may have entered europe in two waves .

surveys of plague pit remains in france and england indicate the first variant entered europe through the port of marseille around november 1347 and spread through france over the next two years , eventually reaching england in the spring of 1349 , where it spread through the country in three epidemics .

the results of the haensch study have since been confirmed and amended . 
based on genetic evidence derived from black death victims in the east smithfield burial site in england , schuenemann et al. concluded in 2011 `` that the black death in medieval europe was caused by a variant of y. pestis that may no longer exist . ''

a study published in nature in october 2011 sequenced the genome of y. pestis from plague victims and indicated that the strain that caused the black death is ancestral to most modern strains of the disease . 
the plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of british bacteriologist j. f. d. shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations .

in 1984 zoologist graham twigg produced the first major work to challenge the bubonic plague theory directly , and his doubts about the identity of the black death have been taken up by a number of authors , including samuel k. cohn , jr. -lrb- 2002 -rrb- , david herlihy -lrb- 1997 -rrb- , and susan scott and christopher duncan -lrb- 2001 -rrb- .

it is recognised that an epidemiological account of the plague is as important as an identification of symptoms , but researchers are hampered by the lack of reliable statistics from this period .

most work has been done on the spread of the plague in england , and even estimates of overall population at the start vary by over 100 % as no census was undertaken between the time of publication of the domesday book and the year 1377 . 
estimates of plague victims are usually extrapolated from figures from the clergy .

in addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the black death are not unique -lrb- and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague -rrb- ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the dna results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves .

other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries ; temperatures that are too cold in northern europe for the survival of fleas ; that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the black death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague ; that mortality rates of the black death appear to be very high ; that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the black death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas ; and that the pattern of the black death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague -- which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups .

many scholars arguing for the y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases , including typhus , smallpox and respiratory infections . 
in addition to the bubonic infection , others point to additional septicemic -lrb- a type of `` blood poisoning '' -rrb- and pneumonic -lrb- an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body -rrb- forms of the plague , which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms . 
in 2014 , scientists with public health england announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the clerkenwell area of london , as well as of wills registered in london during the period , which supported the pneumonic hypothesis . 
the most widely accepted estimate for the middle east , including iraq , iran and syria , during this time , is for a death rate of about a third . 
half of paris 's population of 100,000 people died . 
interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead , recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in central london found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated , evenly spaced graves , suggesting at least some pre-planning and christian burials at this time . 
in crowded cities , it was not uncommon for as much as 50 % of the population to die . 
the disease bypassed some areas , and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion . 
the plague repeatedly returned to haunt europe and the mediterranean throughout the 14th to 17th centuries . 
according to biraben , the plague was present somewhere in europe in every year between 1346 and 1671 . 
according to geoffrey parker , `` france alone lost almost a million people to the plague in the epidemic of 1628 -- 31 . '' 
in england , in the absence of census figures , historians propose a range of preincident population figures from as high as 7 million to as low as 4 million in 1300 , and a postincident population figure as low as 2 million . 
by the end of 1350 , the black death subsided , but it never really died out in england . 
an outbreak in 1471 took as much as 10 -- 15 % of the population , while the death rate of the plague of 1479 -- 80 could have been as high as 20 % . 
the most general outbreaks in tudor and stuart england seem to have begun in 1498 , 1535 , 1543 , 1563 , 1589 , 1603 , 1625 , and 1636 , and ended with the great plague of london in 1665 . 
in 1466 , perhaps 40,000 people died of the plague in paris . 
the black death ravaged europe for three years before it continued on into russia , where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 to 1490 . 
late outbreaks in central europe included the italian plague of 1629 -- 1631 , which is associated with troop movements during the thirty years ' war , and the great plague of vienna in 1679 . 
the last plague outbreak ravaged oslo in 1654 . 
plague occurred in venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528 . 
in the first half of the 17th century , a plague claimed some 1.7 million victims in italy , or about 14 % of the population . 
in 1656 , the plague killed about half of naples ' 300,000 inhabitants . 
the plague of 1649 probably reduced the population of seville by half . 
in 1709 -- 13 , a plague epidemic that followed the great northern war -lrb- 1700 -- 21 , sweden v. russia and allies -rrb- killed about 100,000 in sweden , and 300,000 in prussia . 
europe 's last major epidemic occurred in 1720 in marseille . 
plague was present in at least one location in the islamic world virtually every year between 1500 and 1850 . 
algiers lost 30 to 50 thousand inhabitants to it in 1620 -- 21 , and again in 1654 -- 57 , 1665 , 1691 , and 1740 -- 42 . 
plague remained a major event in ottoman society until the second quarter of the 19th century . 
baghdad has suffered severely from visitations of the plague , and sometimes two-thirds of its population has been wiped out . 
when a rock crystallizes from melt -lrb- magma and/or lava -rrb- , it is an igneous rock . 
the sedimentary rock can then be subsequently turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure and is then weathered , eroded , deposited , and lithified , ultimately becoming a sedimentary rock . 
all three types of rocks may be re-melted ; when this happens , a new magma is formed , from which an igneous rock may once again crystallize . 
there are three major types of rock : igneous , sedimentary , and metamorphic . 
this rock can be weathered and eroded , and then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock , or be turned into a metamorphic rock due to heat and pressure that change the mineral content of the rock which gives it a characteristic fabric . 
in the 1960s , a series of discoveries , the most important of which was seafloor spreading , showed that the earth 's lithosphere , which includes the crust and rigid uppermost portion of the upper mantle , is separated into a number of tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming , solid , upper mantle , which is called the asthenosphere .

this coupling between rigid plates moving on the surface of the earth and the convecting mantle is called plate tectonics .

mid-ocean ridges , high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist , were explained as divergent boundaries , where two plates move apart . 
arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes were explained as convergent boundaries , where one plate subducts under another . 
transform boundaries , such as the san andreas fault system , resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes . 
plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for alfred wegener 's theory of continental drift , in which the continents move across the surface of the earth over geologic time . 
the power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle . 
seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the earth . 
these advances led to the development of a layered model of the earth , with a crust and lithosphere on top , the mantle below -lrb- separated within itself by seismic discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers -rrb- , and the outer core and inner core below that .

therefore , the second scale shows the most recent eon with an expanded scale . 
since the quaternary is a very short period with short epochs , it is further expanded in the fourth scale . 
the holocene -lrb- the latest epoch -rrb- is too small to be shown clearly on the third timeline on the right , another reason for expanding the fourth scale . 
q stands for the quaternary period . 
the principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences through which they cut . 
faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault . 
finding the key bed in these situations may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault . 
faults are younger than the rocks they cut ; accordingly , if a fault is found that penetrates some formations but not those on top of it , then the formations that were cut are older than the fault , and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault . 
as a result , xenoliths are older than the rock which contains them . 
these foreign bodies are picked up as magma or lava flows , and are incorporated , later to cool in the matrix . 
the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions -lrb- or clasts -rrb- are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them . 
the principle of inclusions and components states that , with sedimentary rocks , if inclusions -lrb- or clasts -rrb- are found in a formation , then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them . 
for example , in sedimentary rocks , it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a newer layer . 
the principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks . 
based on principles laid out by william smith almost a hundred years before the publication of charles darwin 's theory of evolution , the principles of succession were developed independently of evolutionary thought . 
the principle becomes quite complex , however , given the uncertainties of fossilization , the localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat -lrb- facies change in sedimentary strata -rrb- , and that not all fossils may be found globally at the same time . 
as organisms exist at the same time period throughout the world , their presence or -lrb- sometimes -rrb- absence may be used to provide a relative age of the formations in which they are found .

at the beginning of the 20th century , important advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to obtain accurate absolute dates to geologic events using radioactive isotopes and other methods . 
previously , geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another . 
with isotopic dates it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units , and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material , converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages .

thermochemical techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust , the uplift of mountain ranges , and paleotopography . 
for many geologic applications , isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature , the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice .

dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques . 
when rock units are placed under horizontal compression , they shorten and become thicker . 
in the shallow crust , where brittle deformation can occur , thrust faults form , which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock . 
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating `` antiforms '' , or where it buckles downwards , creating `` synforms '' . 
these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards , creating `` antiforms '' , or where it buckles downwards , creating `` synforms '' . 
if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards , they are called anticlines and synclines , respectively . 
extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner . 
these stretched rocks can also pinch into lenses , known as boudins , after the french word for `` sausage '' , because of their visual similarity . 
stretching of units can result in their thinning ; in fact , there is a location within the maria fold and thrust belt in which the entire sedimentary sequence of the grand canyon can be seen over a length of less than a meter . 
rocks at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed . 
this is primarily accomplished through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning . 
dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed . 
dikes , long , planar igneous intrusions , enter along cracks , and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed . 
faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients , causing material on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels . 
continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment , and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit . 
deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity . 
the hawaiian islands , for example , consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows . 
even older rocks , such as the acasta gneiss of the slave craton in northwestern canada , the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is undiscernable without laboratory analysis . 
the sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental united states and the grand canyon in the southwestern united states contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since cambrian time .

in addition to identifying rocks in the field , petrologists identify rock samples in the laboratory . 
in an optical mineralogy analysis , thin sections of rock samples are analyzed through a petrographic microscope , where the minerals can be identified through their different properties in plane-polarized and cross-polarized light , including their birefringence , pleochroism , twinning , and interference properties with a conoscopic lens . 
stable and radioactive isotope studies provide insight into the geochemical evolution of rock units .

this research can be extrapolated to the field to understand metamorphic processes and the conditions of crystallization of igneous rocks . 
structural geologists use microscopic analysis of oriented thin sections of geologic samples to observe the fabric within the rocks which gives information about strain within the crystalline structure of the rocks .

they also plot and combine measurements of geological structures in order to better understand the orientations of faults and folds in order to reconstruct the history of rock deformation in the area . 
in addition , they perform analog and numerical experiments of rock deformation in large and small settings . 
among the most well-known experiments in structural geology are those involving orogenic wedges , which are zones in which mountains are built along convergent tectonic plate boundaries .

numerical models work in the same way as these analog models , though they are often more sophisticated and can include patterns of erosion and uplift in the mountain belt . 
in the laboratory , stratigraphers analyze samples of stratigraphic sections that can be returned from the field , such as those from drill cores . 
stratigraphers also analyze data from geophysical surveys that show the locations of stratigraphic units in the subsurface . 
geophysical data and well logs can be combined to produce a better view of the subsurface , and stratigraphers often use computer programs to do this in three dimensions .

stratigraphers can then use these data to reconstruct ancient processes occurring on the surface of the earth , interpret past environments , and locate areas for water , coal , and hydrocarbon extraction . 
geochronologists precisely date rocks within the stratigraphic section in order to provide better absolute bounds on the timing and rates of deposition . 
in the laboratory , biostratigraphers analyze rock samples from outcrop and drill cores for the fossils found in them . 
magnetic stratigraphers look for signs of magnetic reversals in igneous rock units within the drill cores .

some modern scholars , such as fielding h. garrison , are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to persia after the muslim conquests had come to an end . 
abu al-rayhan al-biruni -lrb- 973 -- 1048 ce -rrb- was one of the earliest persian geologists , whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of india , hypothesizing that the indian subcontinent was once a sea . 
in china , the polymath shen kuo -lrb- 1031 -- 1095 -rrb- formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation : based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean , he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt . 
drawing from greek and indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the muslim conquests , the persian scholar ibn sina -lrb- avicenna , 981 -- 1037 -rrb- proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains , the origin of earthquakes , and other topics central to modern geology , which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science .

james hutton is often viewed as the first modern geologist . 
in 1785 he presented a paper entitled theory of the earth to the royal society of edinburgh . 
hutton published a two-volume version of his ideas in 1795 -lrb- vol . 
in his paper , he explained his theory that the earth must be much older than had previously been supposed in order to allow enough time for mountains to be eroded and for sediments to form new rocks at the bottom of the sea , which in turn were raised up to become dry land . 
the first geological map of the u.s. was produced in 1809 by william maclure . 
the first geological map of the u.s. was produced in 1809 by william maclure . 
in 1807 , maclure commenced the self-imposed task of making a geological survey of the united states . 
the results of his unaided labours were submitted to the american philosophical society in a memoir entitled observations on the geology of the united states explanatory of a geological map , and published in the society 's transactions , together with the nation 's first geological map .

-lsb- not in citation given -rsb- the regional nickname and dialect for people from newcastle and the surrounding area is geordie . 
the city developed around the roman settlement pons aelius and was named after the castle built in 1080 by robert curthose , william the conqueror 's eldest son . 
the city grew as an important centre for the wool trade in the 14th century , and later became a major coal mining area .

fragments of hadrian 's wall are still visible in parts of newcastle , particularly along the west road . 
the extent of hadrian 's wall was 73 miles -lrb- 117 km -rrb- , spanning the width of britain ; the wall incorporated the vallum , a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds , and was constructed primarily for defence , to prevent unwanted immigration and the incursion of pictish tribes from the north , not as a fighting line for a major invasion . 
throughout the middle ages , newcastle was england 's northern fortress . 
incorporated first by henry ii , the city had a new charter granted by elizabeth in 1589 . 
a 25-foot -lrb- 7.6 m -rrb- high stone wall was built around the town in the 13th century , to defend it from invaders during the border war against scotland . 
the scots king william the lion was imprisoned in newcastle in 1174 , and edward i brought the stone of scone and william wallace south through the town . 
newcastle was successfully defended against the scots three times during the 14th century , and was created a county corporate with its own sheriff by henry iv in 1400 . 
from 1530 a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from tyneside to newcastle quayside , giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of newcastle burgesses known as the hostmen .

the phrase itself means a pointless pursuit . 
in the 18th century american timothy dexter , an entrepreneur , widely regarded as an eccentric , defied this idiom . 
he was persuaded to sail a shipment of coal to newcastle by merchants plotting to ruin him ; however his shipment arrived on the tyne during a strike that had crippled local production ; unexpectedly he made a considerable profit . 
in the sandgate area , to the east of the city and beside the river , resided the close-knit community of keelmen and their families . 
they were so called because they worked on the keels , boats that were used to transfer coal from the river banks to the waiting colliers , for export to london and elsewhere . 
in the 1630s about 7,000 out of 20,000 inhabitants of newcastle died of plague , more than one-third of the population . 
specifically within the year 1636 , it is roughly estimated with evidence held by the society of antiquaries that 47 % of the then population of newcastle died from the epidemic ; this may also have been the most devastating loss in any british city in this period .

during the english civil war , the north declared for the king . 
in a bid to gain newcastle and the tyne , cromwell 's allies , the scots , captured the town of newburn . 
in 1644 the city was then besieged for many months and was eventually stormed -lrb- ` with roaring drummes ' -rrb- and sacked by cromwell 's allies . 
the grateful king bestowed the motto `` fortiter defendit triumphans '' -lrb- `` triumphing by a brave defence '' -rrb- upon the town . 
charles i was imprisoned in newcastle by the scots in 1646 -- 7 . 
this revolution resulted in the urbanization of the city . 
in 1817 the maling company , at one time the largest pottery company in the world , moved to the city . 
newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting . 
in the 19th century , shipbuilding and heavy engineering were central to the city 's prosperity ; and the city was a powerhouse of the industrial revolution . 
innovations in newcastle and surrounding areas included the development of safety lamps , stephenson 's rocket , lord armstrong 's artillery , be-ro flour , joseph swan 's electric light bulbs , and charles parsons ' invention of the steam turbine , which led to the revolution of marine propulsion and the production of cheap electricity . 
in large parts , newcastle still retains a medieval street layout . 
narrow alleys or ` chares ' , most of which can only be traversed by foot , still exist in abundance , particularly around the riverside . 
stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant castle keep , originally recorded in the 14th century , remain intact in places .

the historic heart of newcastle is the grainger town area . 
established on classical streets built by richard grainger , a builder and developer , between 1835 and 1842 , some of newcastle upon tyne 's finest buildings and streets lie within this area of the city centre including grainger market , theatre royal , grey street , grainger street and clayton street . 
these buildings are predominantly four stories high , with vertical dormers , domes , turrets and spikes . 
of grainger town 's 450 buildings , 244 are listed , of which 29 are grade i and 49 are grade ii * . 
the grainger market replaced an earlier market originally built in 1808 called the butcher market . 
the grainger market itself , was opened in 1835 and was newcastle 's first indoor market . 
the opening was celebrated with a grand dinner attended by 2000 guests , and the laing art gallery has a painting of this event .

the dialect of newcastle is known as geordie , and contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive word pronunciations not used in other parts of the united kingdom . 
the geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the anglo-saxon populations who migrated to and conquered much of england after the end of roman imperial rule . 
this language was the forerunner of modern english ; but while the dialects of other english regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages -- particularly latin and norman french -- the geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language . 
an example of this is the pronunciation of certain words : `` dead '' , `` cow '' , `` house '' and `` strong '' are pronounced `` deed '' , `` coo '' , `` hoos '' and `` strang '' -- which is how they were pronounced in the anglo-saxon language . 
other geordie words with anglo-saxon origins include : `` larn '' -lrb- from the anglo-saxon `` laeran '' , meaning `` teach '' -rrb- , `` burn '' -lrb- `` stream '' -rrb- and `` gan '' -lrb- `` go '' -rrb- . 
`` bairn '' and `` hyem '' , meaning `` child '' and `` home '' , respectively , are examples of geordie words with origins in scandinavia ; barn and hjem are the corresponding modern norwegian and danish words . 
some words used in the geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the northern united kingdom . 
the words `` bonny '' -lrb- meaning `` pretty '' -rrb- , `` howay '' -lrb- `` come on '' -rrb- , `` stot '' -lrb- `` bounce '' -rrb- and `` hadaway '' -lrb- `` go away '' or `` you 're kidding '' -rrb- , all appear to be used in scots ; `` aye '' -lrb- `` yes '' -rrb- and `` nowt '' -lrb- ipa : / / naʊt / , rhymes with out , `` nothing '' -rrb- are used elsewhere in northern england . 
many words , however , appear to be used exclusively in newcastle and the surrounding area , such as `` canny '' -lrb- a versatile word meaning `` good '' , `` nice '' or `` very '' -rrb- , `` hacky '' -lrb- `` dirty '' -rrb- , `` netty '' -lrb- `` toilet '' -rrb- , `` hoy '' -lrb- `` throw '' , from the dutch gooien , via west frisian -rrb- , `` hockle '' -lrb- `` spit '' -rrb- .

the report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city 's residents . 
the report was criticized , however , for attaching too much weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations , which in newcastle 's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access .

however , abc made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming , with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of nbc and cbs , adopting the use of the magnetophon tape recorder , brought to the u.s. from nazi germany after its conquest , to pre-record its programming . 
abc became an aggressive competitor to nbc and cbs when , continuing nbc blue 's traditions of public service , it aired symphony performances conducted by paul whiteman , performances from the metropolitan opera , and jazz concerts aired as part of its broadcast of the chamber music society of lower basin street announced by milton cross .

a second period of international expansion is linked to that of the espn network in the 1990s , and policies enacted in the 2000s by disney media networks -lrb- which included the expansion of several of the company 's u.s.-based cable networks including disney channel and its spinoffs toon disney , playhouse disney and jetix ; although disney also sold its 33 % stake in european sports channel eurosport for $ 155 million in june 2000 -rrb- . 
the policy regarding wholly owned international networks was revived in 2004 when on september 27 of that year , abc announced the launch of abc1 , a free-to-air channel in the united kingdom owned by the abc group . 
however , on september 8 , 2007 , disney announced that it would discontinue abc1 citing to the channel 's inability to attain sustainable viewership . 
with abc1 's shutdown that october , the company 's attempt to develop abc international were discontinued . 
in contrast to disney 's other channels , abc is broadcast in the united states , although the network 's programming is syndicated in many countries . 
in 1959 , this rerun activity was completed with program syndication , with abc films selling programs to networks not owned by abc . 
the arrival of satellite television ended the need for abc to hold interests in other countries ; many governments also wanted to increase their independence and strengthen legislation to limit foreign ownership of broadcasting properties .

in 1998 , abc premiered the aaron sorkin-created sitcom sports night , centering on the travails of the staff of a sportscenter-style sports news program ; despite earning critical praise and multiple emmy awards , the series was cancelled in 2000 after two seasons . 
it was not until the 1965 -- 66 season that color became the dominant format for the three broadcast television networks . 
abc , meanwhile , remained in third place and still needed money to grow itself into a major competitor . 
however , abc 's issues with its transition to color became secondary compared to the network 's financial problems ; in 1964 , the network found itself , as goldenson later wrote in the 1991 book `` beating the odds : the untold story behind the rise of abc '' , `` in the middle of a war -lsb- where -rsb- the battlefield was wall street '' . 
on may 1 , 1953 , abc 's new york city flagship stations -- wjz , wjz-fm and wjz-tv -- changed their respective callsigns to wabc , wabc-fm and wabc-tv , and moved their operations to facilities at 7 west 66th street , one block away from central park .

the wjz calls would later be reassigned to the then-abc affiliate in baltimore in 1959 , in an historical nod to the fact that wjz was originally established by the baltimore station 's owner at the time , westinghouse . 
in 1950 , noble appointed robert kintner to be abc 's president while he himself served as its ceo , a position he would hold until his death in 1958 . 
goldenson added to the confusion when , in october 1954 , he proposed a merger between upt and the dumont television network , which was also mired in financial trouble . 
as part of this merger , the network would have been renamed `` abc-dumont '' for five years , and dumont would have received $ 5 million in cash , room on the schedule for existing dumont programming , and guaranteed advertising time for dumont laboratories receivers .

at the same time he made attempts to help grow abc , goldenson had been trying since mid-1953 to provide content for the network by contacting his old acquaintances in hollywood , with whom he had worked when upt was a subsidiary of paramount pictures . 
abc 's flagship productions at the time were the lone ranger , based on the radio program of the same title , and the adventures of ozzie and harriet , the latter of which -lrb- at 13 seasons , running from 1952 to 1965 -rrb- held the record for the longest-running prime time comedy in u.s. television history , until it was surpassed by the simpsons in 2002 .

airing during the 1955 -- 56 season , it showcased television adaptations of the 1942 films kings row and casablanca ; cheyenne -lrb- adapted from the 1947 film wyoming kid -rrb- ; sugarfoot -lrb- a remake of the 1954 film the boy from oklahoma -rrb- ; and maverick .

however , the most iconic of abc 's relationships with hollywood producers was its agreement with walt disney ; after the start of the network 's bond with the disney studio , james lewis baughman , who worked as a columnist at that time , observed that `` at abc 's headquarters in new york , the secretaries -lsb- were now -rsb- wearing hats with mickey mouse ears '' . 
warner tried with mixed success to adapt some of its most successful films as abc television series , and showcase these adaptations as part of the wheel series warner bros. . 
walt disney and his brother roy contacted goldenson at the end of 1953 for abc to agree to finance part of the disneyland project in exchange for producing a television program for the network . 
walt wanted abc to invest $ 500,000 and accrued a guarantee of $ 4.5 million in additional loans , a third of the budget intended for the park . 
around 1954 , abc agreed to finance disneyland in exchange for the right to broadcast a new sunday night program , disneyland , which debuted on the network on october 27 , 1954 as the first of many anthology television programs that disney would broadcast over the course of the next 50 years .

in july 1968 , abc radio launched a special programming project for its fm stations , which was spearheaded by allen shaw , a former program manager at wcfl in chicago who was approached by abc radio president harold l. neal to develop a format to compete with the new progressive rock and dj-helmed stations .

the new concept called `` love radio '' , which featured a limited selection of music genres , was launched on abc 's seven owned-and-operated fm stations in late november 1968 ; the concept replaced nearly all of the programming provided by these stations ; however , several affiliates -lrb- such as kxyz -rrb- retained the majority of their content .

on the television side , in september 1969 , abc launched the movie of the week , a weekly showcase aimed at capitalizing on the growing success of made-for-tv movies since the early 1960s . 
the movie of the week broadcast feature-length dramatic films directed by such talented filmmakers as aaron spelling , david wolper and steven spielberg -lrb- the latter of whom gained early success through the showcase for his 1971 film duel -rrb- that were produced on an average budget of $ 400,000 -- $ 450,000 .

it also began to use behavioral and demographic data to better determine what types of sponsors to sell advertising slots to and provide programming that would appeal towards certain audiences . 
in 1970 , abc debuted monday night football as part of its monday prime time schedule ; the program became a hit for the network and served as the national football league -lrb- nfl -rrb- 's premier game of the week until 2006 , when sunday night football , which moved to nbc that year as part of a broadcast deal that in turn saw mnf move to espn , took over as the league 's marquee game .

according to goldenson , monday night football helped earn abc regularly score an audience share of 15 % -- 16 % ; abc sports managed the budget for the monday night time slot to reallocate the weekly budget for abc 's prime time schedule to just six days , as opposed to seven on competing networks . 
in 1970 , the fcc voted to pass the financial interest and syndication rules , a set of regulations aimed at preventing the major networks from monopolizing the broadcast landscape by barring them from owning any of the prime time programming that they broadcast . 
in 1972 , the new rules resulted in the company 's decision to split abc films into two separate companies : the existing worldvision enterprises , which would produce and distribute programming for u.s. syndication , and abc circle films as a production unit .

in the early 1970s , michael eisner , who joined abc in 1966 , became the network 's program development manager . 
he helped bring about ideas for many series including happy days -lrb- which originated as a segment on the anthology series love , american style -rrb- , as well as several soap operas ; however , eisner 's main credit at abc was for developing youth-oriented programming .

the network 's troubles with sustaining existing series and gaining new hits spilled over into its 2010 -- 11 schedule : abc 's dramas during that season continued to fail , with the midseason forensic investigation drama body of proof being the only one that was renewed for a second season . 
the network also struggled to establish new comedies to support the previous year 's debuts , with only late-season premiere happy endings earning a second season .

as a result , with the exception of the largest markets , abc was relegated to secondary status on one or both of the existing stations , usually via off-hours clearances -lrb- a notable exception during this time was wkst-tv in youngstown , ohio , now wytv , despite the small size of the surrounding market and its close proximity to cleveland and pittsburgh even decades before the city 's economic collapse -rrb- . 
according to goldenson , this meant that an hour of abc programming reported five times lower viewership than its competitors . 
still , abc 's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades ; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time abc affiliate until the 1960s , with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s , which allowed stations like wtrf-tv in wheeling , west virginia to begin airing abc programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network 's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before .

due to pressure from film studios wanting to increase their production , as the major networks began airing theatrically released films , abc joined cbs and nbc in broadcasting films on sunday nights in 1962 , with the launch of the abc sunday night movie , which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white . 
despite a significant increase in viewership -lrb- with its audience share having increased to 33 % from the 15 % share it had in 1953 -rrb- , abc remained in third place ; the company had a total revenue of $ 15.5 million , a third of the revenue pulled in by cbs at the same period .

the merger was suspended , and a complaint was filed by the department of justice in july 1967 , with itt going to trial in october 1967 ; the merger was officially canceled after the trial 's conclusion on january 1 , 1968 .

to counteract nbc , abc decided to refocus itself on comedies and family-oriented series beginning in the mid-1980s including mr. belvedere , roseanne , who 's the boss ? 
following the initial success of these series , abc revamped its friday night schedule around family-friendly comedies in the late 1980s , culminating in the 1989 debut of the `` tgif '' block -lrb- which promotions referenced stood for `` thank goodness it 's funny '' -rrb- .

many of the series featured during the run of the block were produced by miller-boyett productions , a warner bros.-based studio that briefly programmed the entire friday lineup during the 1990 -- 91 season -lrb- with going places joining family matters , full house and perfect strangers on the `` tgif '' schedule -rrb- and through its development deal with paramount television prior to 1986 -lrb- as miller-milkis , and later , miller-milkis-boyett productions -rrb- , had earlier produced happy days and its various spinoffs among other series for the network .

in 1968 , abc took advantage of new fcc ownership regulations that allowed broadcasting companies to own a maximum of seven radio stations nationwide in order to purchase houston radio stations kxyz and kxyz-fm for $ 1 million in shares and $ 1.5 million in bonds . 
that year , roone arledge was named president of abc sports ; the company also founded abc pictures , a film production company which released its first picture that year , the ralph nelson-directed charly .

it was renamed abc motion pictures in 1979 ; the unit was dissolved in 1985 . 
in july 1968 , abc continued its acquisitions in the amusement parks sector with the opening of abc marine world in redwood city , california ; that park was sold in 1972 and demolished in 1986 , with the land that occupied the park later becoming home to the headquarters of oracle corporation . 
it was not until the late 1950s that the abc network became a serious contender to nbc and cbs , and this was in large part due to the diverse range of programming that met the expectations of the public , such as westerns and detective series . 
despite an almost 500 % increase in advertising revenues between 1953 and 1958 , the network only had a national reach of between 10 % and 18 % of the total u.s. population , as it still had relatively fewer affiliates than nbc and cbs .

in 1957 , abc entertainment president ollie treiz discovered that the locally produced variety show bandstand had pulled very strong ratings in the philadelphia market on wfil-tv ; treiz ultimately negotiated a deal to take the show national , under the revised title american bandstand ; the show quickly became a social phenomenon by presenting new musical talent and dances to america 's youth and helped make a star out of its host , dick clark .

these kinds of programs presented abc with an image of the `` philosophy of counterprogramming against its competitors '' , offering a strong lineup of programs that contrasted with those seen on its rival networks , which helped goldenson give the network a continuum between film and television . 
abc 's western series -lrb- as well as series such as the actioner zorro -rrb- went up against and defeated the variety shows aired by nbc and cbs in the fall of 1957 , and its detective shows did the same in the fall of 1959 . 
in may 1961 , life criticized the public enthusiasm and sponsorship for these types of shows at the expense of news programming and denounced an unofficial law `` replacing the good programs with the bad ones '' .

in may 2013 , abc launched `` watch abc '' , a revamp of its traditional multi-platform streaming services encompassing the network 's existing streaming portal at abc.com and a mobile app for smartphones and tablet computers ; in addition to providing full-length episodes of abc programs , the service allows live programming streams of local abc affiliates in select markets -lrb- the first such offering by a u.s. broadcast network -rrb- . 
new york city o&o wabc-tv and philadelphia o&o wpvi-tv were the first stations to offer streams of their programming on the service -lrb- with a free preview for non-subscribers through june 2013 -rrb- , with the six remaining abc o&o s offering streams by the start of the 2013 -- 14 season . 
hearst television also reached a deal to offer streams of its abc affiliates -lrb- including stations in boston , kansas city , milwaukee and west palm beach -rrb- on the service . 
similar to sister network espn 's watchespn service -lrb- which originated the `` watch '' brand used by the streaming services of disney 's television networks -rrb- , live streams of abc stations are only available to authenticated subscribers of participating pay television providers in certain markets .

after founding the mongol empire and being proclaimed `` genghis khan '' , he started the mongol invasions that resulted in the conquest of most of eurasia . 
he came to power by uniting many of the nomadic tribes of northeast asia . 
these campaigns were often accompanied by wholesale massacres of the civilian populations -- especially in the khwarezmian and xia controlled lands . 
by the end of his life , the mongol empire occupied a substantial portion of central asia and china . 
these included raids or invasions of the qara khitai , caucasus , khwarezmid empire , western xia and jin dynasties . 
before genghis khan died , he assigned ögedei khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons . 
he died in 1227 after defeating the western xia .

before genghis khan died , he assigned ögedei khan as his successor and split his empire into khanates among his sons and grandsons . 
he was buried in an unmarked grave somewhere in mongolia at an unknown location . 
temüjin was probably born in 1162 in delüün boldog , near burkhan khaldun mountain and the onon and kherlen rivers in modern-day northern mongolia , not far from the current capital ulaanbaatar . 
he was the second-oldest son of his father yesügei , a khamag mongol 's major chief of the kiyad and an ally of toghrul khan of the keraite tribe , and the oldest son of his mother hoelun . 
temüjin was probably born in 1162 in delüün boldog , near burkhan khaldun mountain and the onon and kherlen rivers in modern-day northern mongolia , not far from the current capital ulaanbaatar . 
according to the secret history , temüjin was named after a tatar chieftain , temüjin-üge , whom his father had just captured . 
temüjin had three brothers named hasar , hachiun , and temüge , and one sister named temülen , as well as two half-brothers named begter and belgutei . 
temüjin had three brothers named hasar , hachiun , and temüge , and one sister named temülen , as well as two half-brothers named begter and belgutei . 
his father arranged a marriage for him , and at nine years of age he was delivered by his father to the family of his future wife börte , who was a member of the tribe khongirad .

temüjin was to live there in service to dai setsen , the head of the new household , until he reached the marriageable age of 12 . 
begter , temujin 's older half-brother , began to exercise the power of the eldest male in the family and eventually temujin 's mother hoelun -lrb- not begter 's mother -rrb- would have to accept him as her husband if and when he became an adult .

temujin 's resentment erupted during one hunting excursion that temüjin and his brother khasar killed their half-brother begter .

in another incident , around 1177 , he was captured in a raid and held prisoner by his father 's former allies , the tayichi'ud . 
the tayichi'ud enslaved temüjin -lrb- reportedly with a cangue , a sort of portable stocks -rrb- , but with the help of a sympathetic guard , the father of chilaun -lrb- who later became a general of genghis khan -rrb- , he was able to escape from the ger -lrb- yurt -rrb- in the middle of the night by hiding in a river crevice .

-lsb- citation needed -rsb- it was around this time that jelme and bo'orchu , two of genghis khan 's future generals , joined forces with him .

at this time , none of the tribal confederations of mongolia were united politically , and arranged marriages were often used to solidify temporary alliances . 
temüjin 's mother hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of mongolia , especially the need for alliances . 
temüjin grew up observing the tough political climate of mongolia , which included tribal warfare , thievery , raids , corruption , and continual acts of revenge carried out between the various confederations , all compounded by interference from foreign forces such as the chinese dynasties to the south . 
temüjin 's mother hoelun taught him many lessons about the unstable political climate of mongolia , especially the need for alliances . 
as previously arranged by his father , temüjin married börte of the onggirat tribe when he was around 16 in order to cement alliances between their respective tribes . 
soon after börte 's marriage to temüjin , she was kidnapped by the merkits and reportedly given away as a wife . 
temüjin rescued her with the help of his friend and future rival , jamukha , and his protector , toghrul khan of the keraite tribe . 
she gave birth to a son , jochi -lrb- 1185 -- 1226 -rrb- , nine months later , clouding the issue of his parentage .

the names of at least six daughters are known , and while they played significant roles behind the scenes during his lifetime , no documents have survived that definitively provide the number or names of daughters born to the consorts of genghis khan . 
temüjin began his ascent to power by offering himself as an ally -lrb- or , according to other sources , a vassal -rrb- to his father 's anda -lrb- sworn brother or blood brother -rrb- toghrul , who was khan of the keraites , and is better known by the chinese title `` wang khan '' , which the jurchen jin dynasty granted him in 1197 .

temüjin turned to toghrul for support , and in response , toghrul offered his vassal 20,000 of his keraite warriors and suggested that he also involve his childhood friend jamukha , who had himself become khan -lrb- ruler -rrb- of his own tribe , the jadaran .

jamukha supported the traditional mongolian aristocracy , while temüjin followed a meritocratic method , and attracted a broader , though lower class , range of followers . 
due to his earlier defeat of the merkits , and a proclamation by the shaman kokochu that the eternal blue sky had set aside the world for temüjin , temüjin began rising to power . 
in 1186 , temüjin was elected khan of the mongols . 
temüjin hastily gathered together his followers to defend against the attack , but he was decisively beaten in the battle of dalan balzhut . 
toghrul , as temüjin 's patron , was exiled to the qara khitai . 
as an incentive for absolute obedience and following his rule of law , the yassa code , temüjin promised civilians and soldiers wealth from future possible war spoils .

he would even have his mother adopt orphans from the conquered tribe , bringing them into his family . 
instead , he took the conquered tribe under his protection and integrated its members into his own tribe . 
one of the later ruptures between toghrul and temüjin was toghrul 's refusal to give his daughter in marriage to jochi , the eldest son of temüjin , a sign of disrespect in the mongolian culture . 
toghrul allied himself with jamukha , who already opposed temüjin 's forces ; however , the internal dispute between toghrul and jamukha , plus the desertion of a number of their allies to temüjin , led to toghrul 's defeat . 
jamukha escaped during the conflict . 
this defeat was a catalyst for the fall and eventual dissolution of the keraite tribe . 
the next direct threat to temüjin was the naimans -lrb- naiman mongols -rrb- , with whom jamukha and his followers took refuge . 
in 1201 , a khuruldai elected jamukha as gür khan , `` universal ruler '' , a title used by the rulers of the qara khitai . 
in 1201 , a khuruldai elected jamukha as gür khan , `` universal ruler '' , a title used by the rulers of the qara khitai . 
before the conflict , however , several generals abandoned jamukha , including subutai , jelme 's well-known younger brother . 
after several battles , jamukha was finally turned over to temüjin by his own men in 1206 . 
according to the secret history , temüjin again offered his friendship to jamukha , asking him to return to his side . 
temüjin had killed the men who betrayed jamukha , stating that he did not want disloyal men in his army . 
jamukha refused the offer of friendship and reunion , saying that there can only be one sun in the sky , and he asked for a noble death . 
the custom is to die without spilling blood , which is granted by breaking the back . 
he seemed to be a quick student , adopting new technologies and ideas that he encountered , such as siege warfare from the chinese . 
he was also ruthless , demonstrated by his tactic of measuring against the linchpin , used against the tribes led by jamukha . 
these include rifts with his early allies such as jamukha -lrb- who also wanted to be a ruler of mongol tribes -rrb- and wang khan -lrb- his and his father 's ally -rrb- , his son jochi , and problems with the most important shaman , who was allegedly trying to drive a wedge between him and his loyal brother khasar . 
his military strategies showed a deep interest in gathering good intelligence and understanding the motivations of his rivals , exemplified by his extensive spy network and yam route systems .

as a result , by 1206 temüjin had managed to unite or subdue the merkits , naimans , mongols , keraites , tatars , uyghurs , and other disparate smaller tribes under his rule . 
at a khuruldai , a council of mongol chiefs , temüjin was acknowledged as `` khan '' of the consolidated tribes and took the new title `` genghis khan '' . 
the title khagan was not conferred on genghis until after his death , when his son and successor , ögedei , took the title for himself and extended it posthumously to his father -lrb- as he was also to be posthumously declared the founder of the yuan dynasty -rrb- .

in 1211 , after the conquest of western xia , genghis khan planned again to conquer the jin dynasty . 
instead , the jin commander sent a messenger , ming-tan , to the mongol side , who defected and told the mongols that the jin army was waiting on the other side of the pass . 
in 1215 genghis besieged , captured , and sacked the jin capital of zhongdu -lrb- modern-day beijing -rrb- . 
this forced the emperor xuanzong to move his capital south to kaifeng , abandoning the northern half of his kingdom to the mongols . 
between 1232 and 1233 , kaifeng fell to the mongols under the reign of genghis ' third son , ögedei khan . 
kuchlug , the deposed khan of the naiman confederation that temüjin defeated and folded into his mongol empire , fled west and usurped the khanate of qara khitai -lrb- also known as the western liao , as it was originally established as remnants of the liao dynasty -rrb- .

therefore , genghis sent only two tumen -lrb- 20,000 soldiers -rrb- against kuchlug , under his younger general , jebe , known as `` the arrow '' .

therefore , genghis sent only two tumen -lrb- 20,000 soldiers -rrb- against kuchlug , under his younger general , jebe , known as `` the arrow '' . 
with such a small force , the invading mongols were forced to change strategies and resort to inciting internal revolt among kuchlug 's supporters , leaving the qara khitai more vulnerable to mongol conquest . 
as a result , kuchlug 's army was defeated west of kashgar . 
by 1218 , as a result of defeat of qara khitai , the mongol empire and its control extended as far west as lake balkhash , which bordered the khwarezmia -lrb- khwarezmid empire -rrb- , a muslim state that reached the caspian sea to the west and persian gulf and the arabian sea to the south .

in the early 13th century , the khwarazmian dynasty was governed by shah ala ad-din muhammad . 
however , inalchuq , the governor of the khwarezmian city of otrar , attacked the caravan that came from mongolia , claiming that the caravan contained spies and therefore was a conspiracy against khwarezmia . 
the shah had all the men shaved and the muslim beheaded and sent his head back with the two remaining ambassadors . 
outraged , genghis khan planned one of his largest invasion campaigns by organizing together around 100,000 soldiers -lrb- 10 tumens -rrb- , his most capable generals and some of his sons . 
genghis khan saw the potential advantage in khwarezmia as a commercial trading partner using the silk road , and he initially sent a 500-man caravan to establish official trade ties with the empire . 
the mongol army under genghis khan , generals and his sons crossed the tien shan mountains by entering the area controlled by the khwarezmian empire . 
after compiling intelligence from many sources genghis khan carefully prepared his army , which was divided into three groups . 
the second division under jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of khwarzemia to form , with the first division , a pincer attack on samarkand . 
the third division under genghis khan and tolui marched to the northwest and attacked khwarzemia from that direction . 
the second division under jebe marched secretly to the southeast part of khwarzemia to form , with the first division , a pincer attack on samarkand . 
this fragmentation was decisive in khwarezmia 's defeats , as it allowed the mongols , although exhausted from the long journey , to immediately set about defeating small fractions of the khwarzemi forces instead of facing a unified defense . 
the mongol army quickly seized the town of otrar , relying on superior strategy and tactics . 
genghis khan ordered the wholesale massacre of many of the civilians , enslaved the rest of the population and executed inalchuq by pouring molten silver into his ears and eyes , as retribution for his actions . 
near the end of the battle the shah fled rather than surrender . 
genghis khan ordered subutai and jebe to hunt him down , giving them 20,000 men and two years to do this . 
after the capital samarkand fell , the capital was moved to bukhara by the remaining men , while genghis khan ordered two of his generals and their forces to completely destroy the remnants of the khwarezmid empire , including not only royal buildings , but entire towns , populations , and even vast swaths of farmland .

according to legend , genghis khan even went so far as to divert a river through the khwarezmid emperor 's birthplace , erasing it from the map . 
the mongols attacked samarkand using captured enemies as body shields . 
after the fortress fell , genghis supposedly reneged on his surrender terms and executed every soldier that had taken arms against him at samarkand . 
the people of samarkand were ordered to evacuate and assemble in a plain outside the city , where they were killed and pyramids of severed heads raised as a symbol of victory . 
the city leaders opened the gates to the mongols , though a unit of turkish defenders held the city 's citadel for another twelve days .

survivors from the citadel were executed , artisans and craftsmen were sent back to mongolia , young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery . 
genghis khan had the city 's surviving population assemble in the main mosque of the town , where he declared that he was the flail of god , sent to punish them for their sins . 
survivors from the citadel were executed , artisans and craftsmen were sent back to mongolia , young men who had not fought were drafted into the mongolian army and the rest of the population was sent into slavery . 
after the defeat of the khwarezmian empire in 1220 , genghis khan gathered his forces in persia and armenia to return to the mongolian steppes . 
under the suggestion of subutai , the mongol army was split into two forces . 
the mongols destroyed the kingdom of georgia , sacked the genoese trade-fortress of caffa in crimea and overwintered near the black sea . 
at the battle of kalka river in 1223 , subutai 's forces defeated the larger kievan force . 
heading home , subutai 's forces attacked the allied forces of the cuman -- kipchaks and the poorly coordinated 80,000 kievan rus ' troops led by mstislav the bold of halych and mstislav iii of kiev who went out to stop the mongols ' actions in the area . 
later under genghis khan 's grandson batu and the golden horde , the mongols returned to conquer volga bulgaria and kievan rus ' in 1237 , concluding the campaign in 1240 . 
later under genghis khan 's grandson batu and the golden horde , the mongols returned to conquer volga bulgaria and kievan rus ' in 1237 , concluding the campaign in 1240 . 
the famous cavalry expedition led by subutai and jebe , in which they encircled the entire caspian sea defeating all armies in their path , remains unparalleled to this day , and word of the mongol triumphs began to trickle to other nations , particularly europe . 
in 1225 both divisions returned to mongolia . 
genghis khan recalled subutai back to mongolia soon afterwards , and jebe died on the road back to samarkand . 
in 1226 , immediately after returning from the west , genghis khan began a retaliatory attack on the tanguts . 
his armies quickly took heisui , ganzhou , and suzhou -lrb- not the suzhou in jiangsu province -rrb- , and in the autumn he took xiliang-fu -lsb- disambiguation needed -rsb- . 
one of the tangut generals challenged the mongols to a battle near helan mountains but was defeated . 
in november , genghis laid siege to the tangut city lingzhou and crossed the yellow river , defeating the tangut relief army . 
according to legend , it was here that genghis khan reportedly saw a line of five stars arranged in the sky and interpreted it as an omen of his victory . 
in 1227 , genghis khan 's army attacked and destroyed the tangut capital of ning hia and continued to advance , seizing lintiao-fu , xining province , xindu-fu , and deshun province in quick succession in the spring . 
at deshun , the tangut general ma jianlong put up a fierce resistance for several days and personally led charges against the invaders outside the city gate . 
ma jianlong later died from wounds received from arrows in battle . 
genghis khan , after conquering deshun , went to liupanshan -lrb- qingshui county , gansu province -rrb- to escape the severe summer . 
not happy with their betrayal and resistance , genghis khan ordered the entire imperial family to be executed , effectively ending the tangut lineage . 
the long running paternity discussion about genghis ' oldest son jochi was particularly contentious because of the seniority of jochi among the brothers . 
in the secret history of the mongols , just before the invasion of the khwarezmid empire by genghis khan , chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept jochi as genghis khan 's successor . 
in the secret history of the mongols , just before the invasion of the khwarezmid empire by genghis khan , chagatai declared before his father and brothers that he would never accept jochi as genghis khan 's successor . 
in response to this tension , and possibly for other reasons , ögedei was appointed as successor . 
genghis khan was aware of the friction between his sons -lrb- particularly between chagatai and jochi -rrb- and worried of possible conflict between them if he died . 
chagatai was considered unstable due to his temper and rash behavior , because of statements he made that he would not follow jochi if he were to become his father 's successor . 
tolui , genghis khan 's youngest son , was not to be his successor because he was the youngest and in the mongol culture , youngest sons were not given much responsibility due to their age . 
ögedei was seen by genghis khan as dependable in character and relatively stable and down to earth and would be a neutral candidate and might defuse the situation between his brothers . 
jochi died in 1226 , during his father 's lifetime . 
rashid al-din reports that the great khan sent for his sons in the spring of 1223 , and while his brothers heeded the order , jochi remained in khorasan . 
juzjani suggests that the disagreement arose from a quarrel between jochi and his brothers in the siege of urgench . 
i would be doing a service if i killed my father when he is hunting , made an alliance with sultan muhammad , brought this land to life and gave assistance and support to the muslims . '' 
juzjani claims that it was in response to hearing of these plans that genghis khan ordered his son secretly poisoned ; however , as sultan muhammad was already dead in 1223 , the accuracy of this story is questionable . 
in august 1227 , during the fall of yinchuan , the capital of western xia , genghis khan died . 
according to the secret history of the mongols genghis khan fell from his horse while hunting and died because of the injury . 
the galician -- volhynian chronicle alleges he was killed by the western xia in battle , while marco polo wrote that he died after the infection of an arrow wound he received during his final campaign . 
later mongol chronicles connect genghis ' death with a western xia princess taken as war booty . 
one chronicle from the early 17th century even relates the legend that the princess hid a small dagger and stabbed him , though some mongol authors have doubted this version and suspected it to be an invention by the rival oirads . 
years before his death , genghis khan asked to be buried without markings , according to the customs of his tribe . 
after he died , his body was returned to mongolia and presumably to his birthplace in khentii aimag , where many assume he is buried somewhere close to the onon river and the burkhan khaldun mountain -lrb- part of the kentii mountain range -rrb- .

the genghis khan mausoleum , constructed many years after his death , is his memorial , but not his burial site . 
in 1939 chinese nationalist soldiers took the mausoleum from its position at the ` lord 's enclosure ' -lrb- mongolian : edsen khoroo -rrb- in mongolia to protect it from japanese troops . 
it was taken through communist-held territory in yan ` an some 900 km on carts to safety at a buddhist monastery , the dongshan dafo dian , where it remained for ten years . 
in 1949 , as communist troops advanced , the nationalist soldiers moved it another 200 km farther west to the famous tibetan monastery of kumbum monastery or ta'er shi near xining , which soon fell under communist control . 
in early 1954 , genghis khan 's bier and relics were returned to the lord 's enclosure in mongolia . 
in 1968 during the cultural revolution , red guards destroyed almost everything of value . 
on october 6 , 2004 , a joint japanese-mongolian archaeological dig uncovered what is believed to be genghis khan 's palace in rural mongolia , which raises the possibility of actually locating the ruler 's long-lost burial site . 
folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find -lrb- the same manner of burial as the sumerian king gilgamesh of uruk and atilla the hun -rrb- . 
folklore says that a river was diverted over his grave to make it impossible to find -lrb- the same manner of burial as the sumerian king gilgamesh of uruk and atilla the hun -rrb- . 
other tales state that his grave was stampeded over by many horses , and that trees were then planted over the site , and the permafrost also did its part in hiding the burial site . 
the mongol empire was governed by a civilian and military code , called the yassa , created by genghis khan . 
the mongol empire was governed by a civilian and military code , called the yassa , created by genghis khan . 
the mongol empire did not emphasize the importance of ethnicity and race in the administrative realm , instead adopting an approach grounded in meritocracy . 
the exception was the role of genghis khan and his family . 
many of the empire 's nomadic inhabitants considered themselves mongols in military and civilian life , including mongols , turks and others and included many diverse khans of various ethnicities as part of the mongol empire such as muhammad khan . 
there were tax exemptions for religious figures and , to some extent , teachers and doctors . 
-lsb- citation needed -rsb- sometime before the rise of genghis khan , ong khan , his mentor and eventual rival , had converted to nestorian christianity . 
the mongol empire practiced religious tolerance because mongol tradition had long held that religion was a personal concept , and not subject to law or interference . 
various mongol tribes were shamanist , buddhist or christian . 
women played a relatively important role in mongol empire and in family , for example töregene khatun was briefly in charge of the mongol empire when next male khagan was being chosen . 
modern scholars refer to the alleged policy of encouraging trade and communication as the pax mongolica -lrb- mongol peace -rrb- . 
however , there is no evidence of this , or of the lifting of discriminatory policies towards sedentary peoples such as the chinese . 
modern mongolian historians say that towards the end of his life , genghis khan attempted to create a civil state under the great yassa that would have established the legal equality of all individuals , including women . 
for this purpose genghis khan invited a khitan prince , chu'tsai , who worked for the jin and had been captured by the mongol army after the jin dynasty was defeated . 
he also realised that such administrators could not be found among his mongol people because they were nomads and thus had no experience governing cities . 
jin had captured power by displacing khitan . 
genghis told chu'tsai , who was a lineal descendant of khitan rulers , that he had avenged chu'tsai 's forefathers . 
genghis khan put absolute trust in his generals , such as muqali , jebe and subutai , and regarded them as close advisors , often extending them the same privileges and trust normally reserved for close family members . 
he allowed them to make decisions on their own when they embarked on campaigns far from the mongol empire capital karakorum . 
muqali , a trusted lieutenant , was given command of the mongol forces against the jin dynasty while genghis khan was fighting in central asia , and subutai and jebe were allowed to pursue the great raid into the caucasus and kievan rus ' , an idea they had presented to the khagan on their own initiative .

while granting his generals a great deal of autonomy in making command decisions , genghis khan also expected unwavering loyalty from them . 
the mongol military was also successful in siege warfare , cutting off resources for cities and towns by diverting certain rivers , taking enemy prisoners and driving them in front of the army , and adopting new ideas , techniques and tools from the people they conquered , particularly in employing muslim and chinese siege engines and engineers to aid the mongol cavalry in capturing cities .

another standard tactic of the mongol military was the commonly practiced feigned retreat to break enemy formations and to lure small enemy groups away from the larger group and defended position for ambush and counterattack .

at the time of his death , the mongol empire stretched from the caspian sea to the sea of japan . 
under genghis 's successor ögedei khan the speed of expansion reached its peak . 
mongol armies pushed into persia , finished off the western xia and the remnants of the khwarezmids , and came into conflict with the imperial song dynasty of china , starting a war that lasted until 1279 and that concluded with the mongols gaining control of all of china . 
genghis khan is credited with bringing the silk road under one cohesive political environment . 
in turkey , genghis khan is looked on as a great military leader , and it is popular for male children to carry his title as name . 
some historians have noted that genghis khan instituted certain levels of meritocracy in his rule , was tolerant of religions and explained his policies clearly to all his soldiers . 
this allowed increased communication and trade between the west , middle east and asia , thus expanding the horizons of all three cultural areas . 
in the early 1990s the memory of genghis khan with the mongolian national identity has had a powerful revival partly because of his perception during the mongolian people 's republic period . 
he is looked upon positively by mongolians for his role in uniting warring tribes . 
for example , it is not uncommon for mongolians to refer to their country as `` genghis khan 's mongolia '' , to themselves as `` genghis khan 's children '' , and to genghis khan as the `` father of the mongols '' especially among the younger generation . 
however , there is a chasm in the perception of his brutality . 
mongolians maintain that the historical records written by non-mongolians are unfairly biased against genghis khan and that his butchery is exaggerated , while his positive role is underrated . 
his face can be found on everyday commodities , from liquor bottles to candy products , and on the largest denominations of 500 , 1,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 , and 20,000 mongolian tögrög -lrb- -rrb- . 
in mongolia today , genghis khan 's name and likeness are endorsed on products , streets , buildings , and other places . 
mongolia 's main international airport in ulaanbaatar is named chinggis khaan international airport . 
there have been repeated discussions about regulating the use of his name and image to avoid trivialization . 
major genghis khan statues have been erected before the parliament and near ulaanbaatar . 
he is also given credit for the introduction of the traditional mongolian script and the creation of the ikh zasag -lrb- great administration -rrb- , the first written mongolian law . 
`` ikh zasag law adopted during genghis khan 's time in mongolia had points to punish illegal matters related to corruption and bribery very heavily , '' mongolian president tsakhiagiin elbegdorj noted .

there are conflicting views of genghis khan in the people 's republic of china with some viewing him positively in the inner mongolia region where there are a monument and buildings about him and where there is a considerable number of mongols in the area with a population of around 5 million , almost twice the population of mongolia .

although the famous mughal emperors were proud descendants of genghis khan and particularly timur , they clearly distanced themselves from the mongol atrocities committed against the khwarizim shahs , turks , persians , the citizens of baghdad and damascus , nishapur , bukhara and historical figures such as attar of nishapur and many other notable muslims . 
however , mughal emperors directly patronized the legacies of genghis khan and timur ; together their names were synonymous with the names of other distinguished personalities particularly among the muslim populations of south asia .

the word pharmacy is derived from its root word pharma which was a term used since the 15th -- 17th centuries . 
the pharma -lrb- as it was referred to -rrb- often operated through a retail shop which , in addition to ingredients for medicines , sold tobacco and patent medicines . 
however , the original greek roots from pharmakos imply sorcery or even poison . 
often the place that did this was called an apothecary and several languages have this as the dominant term , though their practices are more akin to a modern pharmacy , in english the term apothecary would today be seen as outdated or only approproriate if herbal remedies were on offer to a large extent . 
the pharmas also used many other herbs not listed .

hospital pharmacies can often be found within the premises of the hospital . 
most hospital medications are unit-dose , or a single dose of medicine . 
several hospital pharmacies have decided to outsource high risk preparations and some other compounding functions to companies who specialize in compounding . 
the high cost of medications and drug-related technology , combined with the potential impact of medications and pharmacy services on patient-care outcomes and patient safety , make it imperative that hospital pharmacies perform at the highest level possible . 
hospital pharmacies usually stock a larger range of medications , including more specialized medications , than would be feasible in the community setting . 
pharmacists provide direct patient care services that optimizes the use of medication and promotes health , wellness , and disease prevention .

consultant pharmacy practice focuses more on medication regimen review -lrb- i.e. `` cognitive services '' -rrb- than on actual dispensing of drugs . 
consultant pharmacists most typically work in nursing homes , but are increasingly branching into other institutions and non-institutional settings . 
traditionally consultant pharmacists were usually independent business owners , though in the united states many now work for several large pharmacy management companies -lrb- primarily omnicare , kindred healthcare and pharmerica -rrb- . 
this trend may be gradually reversing as consultant pharmacists begin to work directly with patients , primarily because many elderly people are now taking numerous medications but continue to live outside of institutional settings . 
some community pharmacies employ consultant pharmacists and/or provide consulting services . 
since about the year 2000 , a growing number of internet pharmacies have been established worldwide . 
many of these pharmacies are similar to community pharmacies , and in fact , many of them are actually operated by brick-and-mortar community pharmacies that serve consumers online and those that walk in their door . 
internet pharmacies -lrb- also known as online pharmacies -rrb- are also recommended to some patients by their physicians if they are homebound . 
some customers consider this to be more convenient and private method rather than traveling to a community drugstore where another customer might overhear about the drugs that they take . 
the primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received . 
many customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the `` inconvenience '' of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications which their doctors were unwilling to prescribe . 
however , this practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous , especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications , risk/benefit ratios , and an individual 's overall suitability for use of a medication . 
there also have been reports of such pharmacies dispensing substandard products . 
while most internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs and require a valid prescription , some internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs without requiring a prescription .

while in most cases importation of prescription medications violates food and drug administration -lrb- fda -rrb- regulations and federal laws , enforcement is generally targeted at international drug suppliers , rather than consumers . 
there is no known case of any u.s. citizens buying canadian drugs for personal use with a prescription , who has ever been charged by authorities .

pharmacy informatics is the combination of pharmacy practice science and applied information science . 
pharmacy informaticists work in many practice areas of pharmacy , however , they may also work in information technology departments or for healthcare information technology vendor companies . 
as a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals . 
pharmacists in this area are trained to participate in medication management system development , deployment and optimization . 
as a practice area and specialist domain , pharmacy informatics is growing quickly to meet the needs of major national and international patient information projects and health system interoperability goals . 
in addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs . 
it is currently the fastest growing sector of the pharmaceutical industry with 19 of 28 newly fda approved medications in 2013 being specialty drugs . 
specialty pharmacies supply high cost injectable , oral , infused , or inhaled medications that are used for chronic and complex disease states such as cancer , hepatitis , and rheumatoid arthritis . 
unlike a traditional community pharmacy where prescriptions for any common medication can be brought in and filled , specialty pharmacies carry novel medications that need to be properly stored , administered , carefully monitored , and clinically managed . 
in addition to supplying these drugs , specialty pharmacies also provide lab monitoring , adherence counseling , and assist patients with cost-containment strategies needed to obtain their expensive specialty drugs . 
in most jurisdictions -lrb- such as the united states -rrb- , pharmacists are regulated separately from physicians . 
these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them `` kickback '' payments . 
however , the american medical association -lrb- ama -rrb- code of ethics provides that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices as long as there is no patient exploitation and patients have the right to a written prescription that can be filled elsewhere . 
7 to 10 percent of american physicians practices reportedly dispense drugs on their own . 
these jurisdictions also usually specify that only pharmacists may supply scheduled pharmaceuticals to the public , and that pharmacists can not form business partnerships with physicians or give them `` kickback '' payments . 
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city . 
in some rural areas in the united kingdom , there are dispensing physicians who are allowed to both prescribe and dispense prescription-only medicines to their patients from within their practices . 
the law requires that the gp practice be located in a designated rural area and that there is also a specified , minimum distance -lrb- currently 1.6 kilometres -rrb- between a patient 's home and the nearest retail pharmacy . 
this law also exists in austria for general physicians if the nearest pharmacy is more than 4 kilometers away , or where none is registered in the city . 
the reason for the majority rule is the high risk of a conflict of interest and/or the avoidance of absolute powers . 
otherwise , the physician has a financial self-interest in `` diagnosing '' as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient . 
this system reflects much similarity to the checks and balances system of the u.s. and many other governments . 
otherwise , the physician has a financial self-interest in `` diagnosing '' as many conditions as possible , and in exaggerating their seriousness , because he or she can then sell more medications to the patient . 
such self-interest directly conflicts with the patient 's interest in obtaining cost-effective medication and avoiding the unnecessary use of medication that may have side-effects . 
in the coming decades , pharmacists are expected to become more integral within the health care system . 
rather than simply dispensing medication , pharmacists are increasingly expected to be compensated for their patient care skills . 
in particular , medication therapy management -lrb- mtm -rrb- includes the clinical services that pharmacists can provide for their patients . 
such services include the thorough analysis of all medication -lrb- prescription , non-prescription , and herbals -rrb- currently being taken by an individual . 
the result is a reconciliation of medication and patient education resulting in increased patient health outcomes and decreased costs to the health care system . 
in canada , pharmacists in certain provinces have limited prescribing rights -lrb- as in alberta and british columbia -rrb- or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews -lrb- medschecks in ontario -rrb- . 
this shift has already commenced in some countries ; for instance , pharmacists in australia receive remuneration from the australian government for conducting comprehensive home medicines reviews . 
they are also being paid for by the government for medicine use reviews . 
in the united states , pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy . 
moreover , the doctor of pharmacy -lrb- pharm . 
the two symbols most commonly associated with pharmacy in english-speaking countries are the mortar and pestle and the ℞ -lrb- recipere -rrb- character , which is often written as `` rx '' in typed text . 
the show globe was also used until the early 20th century . 
pharmacy organizations often use other symbols , such as the bowl of hygieia which is often used in the netherlands , conical measures , and caduceuses in their logos . 
other symbols are common in different countries : the green greek cross in france , argentina , the united kingdom , belgium , ireland , italy , spain , and india , the increasingly rare gaper in the netherlands , and a red stylized letter a in germany and austria -lrb- from apotheke , the german word for pharmacy , from the same greek root as the english word ` apothecary ' -rrb- .

the immune system is a system of many biological structures and processes within an organism that protects against disease . 
to function properly , an immune system must detect a wide variety of agents , known as pathogens , from viruses to parasitic worms , and distinguish them from the organism 's own healthy tissue . 
in many species , the immune system can be classified into subsystems , such as the innate immune system versus the adaptive immune system , or humoral immunity versus cell-mediated immunity . 
in humans , the blood -- brain barrier , blood -- cerebrospinal fluid barrier , and similar fluid -- brain barriers separate the peripheral immune system from the neuroimmune system which protects the brain .

pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt , and thereby avoid detection and neutralization by the immune system ; however , multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens . 
even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . 
other basic immune mechanisms evolved in ancient eukaryotes and remain in their modern descendants , such as plants and invertebrates . 
adaptive -lrb- or acquired -rrb- immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . 
even simple unicellular organisms such as bacteria possess a rudimentary immune system , in the form of enzymes that protect against bacteriophage infections . 
these mechanisms include phagocytosis , antimicrobial peptides called defensins , and the complement system . 
this process of acquired immunity is the basis of vaccination . 
adaptive -lrb- or acquired -rrb- immunity creates immunological memory after an initial response to a specific pathogen , leading to an enhanced response to subsequent encounters with that same pathogen . 
disorders of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases , inflammatory diseases and cancer . 
immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections .

in humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as hiv/aids , or the use of immunosuppressive medication . 
common autoimmune diseases include hashimoto 's thyroiditis , rheumatoid arthritis , diabetes mellitus type 1 , and systemic lupus erythematosus . 
immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal , resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections . 
in contrast , autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms . 
immunology covers the study of all aspects of the immune system . 
in humans , immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency , acquired conditions such as hiv/aids , or the use of immunosuppressive medication . 
the earliest known reference to immunity was during the plague of athens in 430 bc . 
in the 18th century , pierre-louis moreau de maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom . 
this and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by louis pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease . 
viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901 , with the discovery of the yellow fever virus by walter reed . 
it was not until robert koch 's 1891 proofs , for which he was awarded a nobel prize in 1905 , that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease .

this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered . 
if a pathogen breaches these barriers , the innate immune system provides an immediate , but non-specific response . 
if pathogens successfully evade the innate response , vertebrates possess a second layer of protection , the adaptive immune system , which is activated by the innate response . 
innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals .

this improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated , in the form of an immunological memory , and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered . 
in simple terms , physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses from entering the organism . 
both innate and adaptive immunity depend on the ability of the immune system to distinguish between self and non-self molecules . 
in immunology , self molecules are those components of an organism 's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system . 
conversely , non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules . 
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens -lrb- short for antibody generators -rrb- and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response . 
one class of non-self molecules are called antigens -lrb- short for antibody generators -rrb- and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response . 
the innate response is usually triggered when microbes are identified by pattern recognition receptors , which recognize components that are conserved among broad groups of microorganisms , or when damaged , injured or stressed cells send out alarm signals , many of which -lrb- but not all -rrb- are recognized by the same receptors as those that recognize pathogens . 
the innate immune system is the dominant system of host defense in most organisms .

innate immune defenses are non-specific , meaning these systems respond to pathogens in a generic way . 
the waxy cuticle of many leaves , the exoskeleton of insects , the shells and membranes of externally deposited eggs , and skin are examples of mechanical barriers that are the first line of defense against infection .

in the lungs , coughing and sneezing mechanically eject pathogens and other irritants from the respiratory tract . 
the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms . 
the flushing action of tears and urine also mechanically expels pathogens , while mucus secreted by the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract serves to trap and entangle microorganisms . 
the skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides such as the β-defensins . 
enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase a2 in saliva , tears , and breast milk are also antibacterials . 
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens . 
in the stomach , gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against ingested pathogens . 
vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche , when they become slightly acidic , while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens . 
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as ph or available iron . 
however , since most antibiotics non-specifically target bacteria and do not affect fungi , oral antibiotics can lead to an `` overgrowth '' of fungi and cause conditions such as a vaginal candidiasis -lrb- a yeast infection -rrb- . 
there is good evidence that re-introduction of probiotic flora , such as pure cultures of the lactobacilli normally found in unpasteurized yogurt , helps restore a healthy balance of microbial populations in intestinal infections in children and encouraging preliminary data in studies on bacterial gastroenteritis , inflammatory bowel diseases , urinary tract infection and post-surgical infections . 
within the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts , commensal flora serve as biological barriers by competing with pathogenic bacteria for food and space and , in some cases , by changing the conditions in their environment , such as ph or available iron . 
inflammation is one of the first responses of the immune system to infection . 
the symptoms of inflammation are redness , swelling , heat , and pain , which are caused by increased blood flow into tissue . 
inflammation is produced by eicosanoids and cytokines , which are released by injured or infected cells . 
eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation , and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells -lrb- leukocytes -rrb- . 
common cytokines include interleukins that are responsible for communication between white blood cells ; chemokines that promote chemotaxis ; and interferons that have anti-viral effects , such as shutting down protein synthesis in the host cell . 
phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called ` phagocytes ' that engulf , or eat , pathogens or particles . 
phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens , but can be called to specific locations by cytokines . 
once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte , it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome , which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome . 
the pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome . 
phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients , but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism . 
neutrophils and macrophages are phagocytes that travel throughout the body in pursuit of invading pathogens . 
neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes . 
neutrophils are normally found in the bloodstream and are the most abundant type of phagocyte , normally representing 50 % to 60 % of the total circulating leukocytes . 
during the acute phase of inflammation , particularly as a result of bacterial infection , neutrophils migrate toward the site of inflammation in a process called chemotaxis , and are usually the first cells to arrive at the scene of infection . 
macrophages are versatile cells that reside within tissues and produce a wide array of chemicals including enzymes , complement proteins , and regulatory factors such as interleukin 1 . 
leukocytes -lrb- white blood cells -rrb- act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system . 
leukocytes -lrb- white blood cells -rrb- act like independent , single-celled organisms and are the second arm of the innate immune system . 
innate cells are also important mediators in the activation of the adaptive immune system . 
the innate leukocytes include the phagocytes -lrb- macrophages , neutrophils , and dendritic cells -rrb- , mast cells , eosinophils , basophils , and natural killer cells . 
dendritic cells -lrb- dc -rrb- are phagocytes in tissues that are in contact with the external environment ; therefore , they are located mainly in the skin , nose , lungs , stomach , and intestines . 
they are named for their resemblance to neuronal dendrites , as both have many spine-like projections , but dendritic cells are in no way connected to the nervous system . 
dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to t cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system . 
dendritic cells serve as a link between the bodily tissues and the innate and adaptive immune systems , as they present antigens to t cells , one of the key cell types of the adaptive immune system . 
rather , nk cells destroy compromised host cells , such as tumor cells or virus-infected cells , recognizing such cells by a condition known as `` missing self . '' 
natural killer cells , or nk cells , are a component of the innate immune system which does not directly attack invading microbes . 
this term describes cells with low levels of a cell-surface marker called mhc i -lrb- major histocompatibility complex -rrb- -- a situation that can arise in viral infections of host cells . 
those mhc antigens are recognized by killer cell immunoglobulin receptors -lrb- kir -rrb- which essentially put the brakes on nk cells . 
the adaptive immune system evolved in early vertebrates and allows for a stronger immune response as well as immunological memory , where each pathogen is `` remembered '' by a signature antigen . 
the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and requires the recognition of specific `` non-self '' antigens during a process called antigen presentation . 
antigen specificity allows for the generation of responses that are tailored to specific pathogens or pathogen-infected cells . 
there are two major subtypes of t cells : the killer t cell and the helper t cell . 
in addition there are regulatory t cells which have a role in modulating immune response . 
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules , while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules . 
killer t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class i mhc molecules , while helper t cells and regulatory t cells only recognize antigens coupled to class ii mhc molecules . 
a third , minor subtype are the γδ t cells that recognize intact antigens that are not bound to mhc receptors . 
killer t cells are a sub-group of t cells that kill cells that are infected with viruses -lrb- and other pathogens -rrb- , or are otherwise damaged or dysfunctional . 
recognition of this mhc : antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the t cell , called cd8 . 
killer t cells are activated when their t cell receptor -lrb- tcr -rrb- binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the mhc class i receptor of another cell . 
the entry of another toxin called granulysin -lrb- a protease -rrb- induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis . 
when an activated t cell contacts such cells , it releases cytotoxins , such as perforin , which form pores in the target cell 's plasma membrane , allowing ions , water and toxins to enter . 
the mhc : antigen complex is also recognized by the helper cell 's cd4 co-receptor , which recruits molecules inside the t cell -lrb- e.g. , lck -rrb- that are responsible for the t cell 's activation . 
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors -lrb- around 200 -- 300 -rrb- on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule . 
helper t cells have a weaker association with the mhc : antigen complex than observed for killer t cells , meaning many receptors -lrb- around 200 -- 300 -rrb- on the helper t cell must be bound by an mhc : antigen in order to activate the helper cell , while killer t cells can be activated by engagement of a single mhc : antigen molecule . 
the activation of a resting helper t cell causes it to release cytokines that influence the activity of many cell types . 
in addition , helper t cell activation causes an upregulation of molecules expressed on the t cell 's surface , such as cd40 ligand -lrb- also called cd154 -rrb- , which provide extra stimulatory signals typically required to activate antibody-producing b cells . 
gamma delta t cells -lrb- γδ t cells -rrb- possess an alternative t cell receptor -lrb- tcr -rrb- as opposed to cd4 + and cd8 + -lrb- αβ -rrb- t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells . 
gamma delta t cells -lrb- γδ t cells -rrb- possess an alternative t cell receptor -lrb- tcr -rrb- as opposed to cd4 + and cd8 + -lrb- αβ -rrb- t cells and share the characteristics of helper t cells , cytotoxic t cells and nk cells . 
like other ` unconventional ' t cell subsets bearing invariant tcrs , such as cd1d-restricted natural killer t cells , γδ t cells straddle the border between innate and adaptive immunity . 
on one hand , γδ t cells are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange tcr genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype . 
for example , large numbers of human vγ9 / vδ2 t cells respond within hours to common molecules produced by microbes , and highly restricted vδ1 + t cells in epithelia respond to stressed epithelial cells . 
a b cell identifies pathogens when antibodies on its surface bind to a specific foreign antigen . 
this antigen/antibody complex is taken up by the b cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides . 
this combination of mhc and antigen attracts a matching helper t cell , which releases lymphokines and activates the b cell . 
when b cells and t cells are activated and begin to replicate , some of their offspring become long-lived memory cells . 
this is `` adaptive '' because it occurs during the lifetime of an individual as an adaptation to infection with that pathogen and prepares the immune system for future challenges . 
immunological memory can be in the form of either passive short-term memory or active long-term memory . 
throughout the lifetime of an animal , these memory cells remember each specific pathogen encountered and can mount a strong response if the pathogen is detected again . 
newborn infants have no prior exposure to microbes and are particularly vulnerable to infection . 
during pregnancy , a particular type of antibody , called igg , is transported from mother to baby directly across the placenta , so human babies have high levels of antibodies even at birth , with the same range of antigen specificities as their mother . 
breast milk or colostrum also contains antibodies that are transferred to the gut of the infant and protect against bacterial infections until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies . 
this passive immunity is usually short-term , lasting from a few days up to several months . 
hormones can act as immunomodulators , altering the sensitivity of the immune system . 
for example , female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses . 
some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially , and their onset often coincides with puberty . 
by contrast , male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive . 
additionally , proteins such as nfil3 , which have been shown to be closely intertwined with both t-cell differentiation and our circadian rhythms , can be affected through the disturbance of natural light and dark cycles through instances of sleep deprivation , shift work , etc. . 
as a result , these disruptions can lead to an increase in chronic conditions such as heart disease , chronic pain , and asthma . 
when suffering from sleep deprivation , active immunizations may have a diminished effect and may result in lower antibody production , and a lower immune response , than would be noted in a well-rested individual . 
it is conjectured that a progressive decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals . 
second , as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin d. 
conversely , some hormones are regulated by the immune system , notably thyroid hormone activity . 
this means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via uvb radiation . 
the main response of the immune system to tumors is to destroy the abnormal cells using killer t cells , sometimes with the assistance of helper t cells . 
nk cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way , especially if the tumor cells have fewer mhc class i molecules on their surface than normal ; this is a common phenomenon with tumors . 
tumor antigens are presented on mhc class i molecules in a similar way to viral antigens . 
sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system . 
unlike animals , plants lack phagocytic cells , but many plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant . 
individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns or pamps . 
when a part of a plant becomes infected , the plant produces a localized hypersensitive response , whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis to prevent the spread of the disease to other parts of the plant . 
systemic acquired resistance -lrb- sar -rrb- is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent . 
rna silencing mechanisms are particularly important in this systemic response as they can block virus replication . 
overactive immune responses comprise the other end of immune dysfunction , particularly the autoimmune disorders . 
here , the immune system fails to properly distinguish between self and non-self , and attacks part of the body . 
one of the functions of specialized cells -lrb- located in the thymus and bone marrow -rrb- is to present young lymphocytes with self antigens produced throughout the body and to eliminate those cells that recognize self-antigens , preventing autoimmunity . 
under normal circumstances , many t cells and antibodies react with `` self '' peptides . 
immunodeficiencies occur when one or more of the components of the immune system are inactive . 
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence . 
the ability of the immune system to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly , with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence . 
in developed countries , obesity , alcoholism , and drug use are common causes of poor immune function . 
however , malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries . 
active immunity can also be generated artificially , through vaccination . 
the principle behind vaccination -lrb- also called immunization -rrb- is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism . 
the principle behind vaccination -lrb- also called immunization -rrb- is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate the immune system and develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism . 
this deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity of the immune system , as well as its inducibility . 
bacteria often overcome physical barriers by secreting enzymes that digest the barrier , for example , by using a type ii secretion system . 
alternatively , using a type iii secretion system , they may insert a hollow tube into the host cell , providing a direct route for proteins to move from the pathogen to the host . 
these proteins are often used to shut down host defenses . 
the success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses . 
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory -lrb- cst -rrb- of immunity . 
on the basis of cst , burnet developed a theory of how an immune response is triggered according to the self/nonself distinction : `` self '' constituents -lrb- constituents of the body -rrb- do not trigger destructive immune responses , while `` nonself '' entities -lrb- pathogens , an allograft -rrb- trigger a destructive immune response . 
the theory was later modified to reflect new discoveries regarding histocompatibility or the complex `` two-signal '' activation of t cells . 
in the mid-1950s , frank burnet , inspired by a suggestion made by niels jerne , formulated the clonal selection theory -lrb- cst -rrb- of immunity . 
glucocorticoids are the most powerful of these drugs ; however , these drugs can have many undesirable side effects , such as central obesity , hyperglycemia , osteoporosis , and their use must be tightly controlled . 
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine . 
lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs are often used in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine . 
immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin prevent t cells from responding to signals correctly by inhibiting signal transduction pathways . 
in contrast , during wake periods differentiated effector cells , such as cytotoxic natural killer cells and ctls -lrb- cytotoxic t lymphocytes -rrb- , peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens . 
as well during awake active times , anti-inflammatory molecules , such as cortisol and catecholamines , peak . 
second , inflammation may occur during sleep times due to the presence of melatonin . 
inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time . 
when a t-cell encounters a foreign pathogen , it extends a vitamin d receptor . 
this is essentially a signaling device that allows the t-cell to bind to the active form of vitamin d , the steroid hormone calcitriol . 
t-cells have a symbiotic relationship with vitamin d. not only does the t-cell extend a vitamin d receptor , in essence asking to bind to the steroid hormone version of vitamin d , calcitriol , but the t-cell expresses the gene cyp27b1 , which is the gene responsible for converting the pre-hormone version of vitamin d , calcidiol into the steroid hormone version , calcitriol .

other immune system cells that are known to express cyp27b1 and thus activate vitamin d calcidiol , are dendritic cells , keratinocytes and macrophages . 
pattern recognition receptors are proteins used by nearly all organisms to identify molecules associated with pathogens . 
antimicrobial peptides called defensins are an evolutionarily conserved component of the innate immune response found in all animals and plants , and represent the main form of invertebrate systemic immunity . 
the complement system and phagocytic cells are also used by most forms of invertebrate life . 
ribonucleases and the rna interference pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes , and are thought to play a role in the immune response to viruses . 
many of the classical molecules of the adaptive immune system -lrb- e.g. , immunoglobulins and t cell receptors -rrb- exist only in jawed vertebrates . 
however , a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates , such as the lamprey and hagfish . 
these animals possess a large array of molecules called variable lymphocyte receptors -lrb- vlrs -rrb- that , like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates , are produced from only a small number -lrb- one or two -rrb- of genes . 
evolution of the adaptive immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates . 
it is likely that a multicomponent , adaptive immune system arose with the first vertebrates , as invertebrates do not generate lymphocytes or an antibody-based humoral response . 
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages . 
immune systems appear even in the structurally most simple forms of life , with bacteria using a unique defense mechanism , called the restriction modification system to protect themselves from viral pathogens , called bacteriophages . 
prokaryotes also possess acquired immunity , through a system that uses crispr sequences to retain fragments of the genomes of phage that they have come into contact with in the past , which allows them to block virus replication through a form of rna interference . 
the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century saw a battle between `` cellular '' and `` humoral '' theories of immunity . 
according to the cellular theory of immunity , represented in particular by elie metchnikoff , it was cells -- more precisely , phagocytes -- that were responsible for immune responses .

in contrast , the humoral theory of immunity , held , among others , by robert koch and emil von behring , stated that the active immune agents were soluble components -lrb- molecules -rrb- found in the organism 's `` humors '' rather than its cells .

clearly , some tumors evade the immune system and go on to become cancers . 
tumor cells often have a reduced number of mhc class i molecules on their surface , thus avoiding detection by killer t cells . 
some tumor cells also release products that inhibit the immune response ; for example by secreting the cytokine tgf-β , which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes .

hypersensitivity is an immune response that damages the body 's own tissues . 
they are divided into four classes -lrb- type i -- iv -rrb- based on the mechanisms involved and the time course of the hypersensitive reaction . 
type i hypersensitivity is an immediate or anaphylactic reaction , often associated with allergy . 
type i hypersensitivity is mediated by ige , which triggers degranulation of mast cells and basophils when cross-linked by antigen . 
type ii hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient 's own cells , marking them for destruction . 
an evasion strategy used by several pathogens to avoid the innate immune system is to hide within the cells of their host -lrb- also called intracellular pathogenesis -rrb- . 
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria -lrb- plasmodium falciparum -rrb- and leishmaniasis -lrb- leishmania spp . -rrb- 
some examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses , the food poisoning bacterium salmonella and the eukaryotic parasites that cause malaria -lrb- plasmodium falciparum -rrb- and leishmaniasis -lrb- leishmania spp . -rrb- 
other bacteria , such as mycobacterium tuberculosis , live inside a protective capsule that prevents lysis by complement . 
other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies , rendering them ineffective ; examples include streptococcus -lrb- protein g -rrb- , staphylococcus aureus -lrb- protein a -rrb- , and peptostreptococcus magnus -lrb- protein l -rrb- . 
this is called antigenic variation . 
an example is hiv , which mutates rapidly , so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing . 
the parasite trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy , constantly switching one type of surface protein for another , allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response . 
masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system . 
this is called immune surveillance . 
the antigens expressed by tumors have several sources ; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus , which causes cervical cancer , while others are the organism 's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells . 
one example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that , when expressed at high levels , transforms certain skin cells -lrb- e.g. melanocytes -rrb- into tumors called melanomas .

larger drugs -lrb- > 500 da -rrb- can provoke a neutralizing immune response , particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly , or in larger doses . 
early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids ; however , more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes , usually on well-studied virus proteins , as a training set . 
immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins -lrb- proteomics -rrb- involved in the immune response . 
a publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by b cells . 
the emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics . 
first , during the early slow-wave-sleep stage , a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol , epinephrine , and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin . 
in addition to these effects , the milieu of hormones produced at this time -lrb- leptin , pituitary growth hormone , and prolactin -rrb- support the interactions between apcs and t-cells , a shift of the th1/th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports th1 , an increase in overall th cell proliferation , and naïve t cell migration to lymph nodes .

this milieu is also thought to support the formation of long-lasting immune memory through the initiation of th1 immune responses . 
in humans , this response is activated by complement binding to antibodies that have attached to these microbes or the binding of complement proteins to carbohydrates on the surfaces of microbes . 
this deposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane . 
the speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs following sequential proteolytic activation of complement molecules , which are also proteases . 
this produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback .

it is generally agreed within the legal community , and is often believed within the activist community , that a suspect 's talking to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose , and may be harmful . 
however , some civil disobedients have nonetheless found it hard to resist responding to investigators ' questions , sometimes due to a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications , or due to a fear of seeming rude . 
also , some civil disobedients seek to use the arrest as an opportunity to make an impression on the officers . 
some civil disobedients feel it is incumbent upon them to accept punishment because of their belief in the validity of the social contract , which is held to bind all to obey the laws that a government meeting certain standards of legitimacy has established , or else suffer the penalties set out in the law .

other civil disobedients who favor the existence of government still do n't believe in the legitimacy of their particular government , or do n't believe in the legitimacy of a particular law it has enacted . 
and still other civil disobedients , being anarchists , do n't believe in the legitimacy of any government , and therefore see no need to accept punishment for a violation of criminal law that does not infringe the rights of others .

an important decision for civil disobedients is whether or not to plead guilty . 
there is much debate on this point , as some believe that it is a civil disobedient 's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law , while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law .

one defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power , when asked to enter his plea , stated , `` i plead for the beauty that surrounds us '' ; this is known as a `` creative plea , '' and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty . 
when the committee for non-violent action sponsored a protest in august 1957 , at the camp mercury nuclear test site near las vegas , nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest . 
when the committee for non-violent action sponsored a protest in august 1957 , at the camp mercury nuclear test site near las vegas , nevada , 13 of the protesters attempted to enter the test site knowing that they faced arrest . 
at a pre-arranged announced time , one at a time they stepped across the `` line '' and were immediately arrested . 
a well known civil rights attorney , francis heisler , had volunteered to defend the arrested persons , advising them to plead `` nolo contendere '' , as an alternative to pleading either guilty or not-guilty . 
the arrested persons were found `` guilty , '' nevertheless , and given suspended sentences , conditional on their not reentering the test site grounds . 
howard zinn writes , `` there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice . 
howard zinn writes , `` there may be many times when protesters choose to go to jail , as a way of continuing their protest , as a way of reminding their countrymen of injustice . 
the key point is that the spirit of protest should be maintained all the way , whether it is done by remaining in jail , or by evading it . 
to accept jail penitently as an accession to ` the rules ' is to switch suddenly to a spirit of subservience , to demean the seriousness of the protest ... in particular , the neo-conservative insistence on a guilty plea should be eliminated . '' 
sometimes the prosecution proposes a plea bargain to civil disobedients , as in the case of the camden 28 , in which the defendants were offered an opportunity to plead guilty to one misdemeanor count and receive no jail time .

in some mass arrest situations , the activists decide to use solidarity tactics to secure the same plea bargain for everyone . 
but some activists have opted to enter a blind plea , pleading guilty without any plea agreement in place . 
mohandas gandhi pleaded guilty and told the court , `` i am here to ... submit cheerfully to the highest penalty that can be inflicted upon me for what in law is a deliberate crime and what appears to me to be the highest duty of a citizen . ''

some of the other allocution speeches given by the protesters complained about mistreatment from government officials . 
steven barkan writes that if defendants plead not guilty , `` they must decide whether their primary goal will be to win an acquittal and avoid imprisonment or a fine , or to use the proceedings as a forum to inform the jury and the public of the political circumstances surrounding the case and their reasons for breaking the law via civil disobedience .

during the vietnam war era , the chicago eight used a political defense , while benjamin spock used a technical defense . 
over the years , this has been made more difficult by court decisions such as sparf v. united states , which held that the judge need not inform jurors of their nullification prerogative , and united states v. dougherty , which held that the judge need not allow defendants to openly seek jury nullification . 
one theory is that , while disobedience may be helpful , any great amount of it would undermine the law by encouraging general disobedience which is neither conscientious nor of social benefit .

it has also been argued that breaking the law for self-gratification , as in the case of a homosexual or cannabis user who does not direct his act at securing the repeal of amendment of the law , is not civil disobedience . 
likewise , a protestor who attempts to escape punishment by committing the crime covertly and avoiding attribution , or by denying having committed the crime , or by fleeing the jurisdiction , is generally viewed as not being a civil disobedient .

courts have distinguished between two types of civil disobedience : `` indirect civil disobedience involves violating a law which is not , itself , the object of protest , whereas direct civil disobedience involves protesting the existence of a particular law by breaking that law . ''

during the vietnam war , courts typically refused to excuse the perpetrators of illegal protests from punishment on the basis of their challenging the legality of the vietnam war ; the courts ruled it was a political question . 
likewise , when carter wentworth was charged for his role in the clamshell alliance 's 1977 illegal occupation of the seabrook station nuclear power plant , the judge instructed the jury to disregard his competing harms defense , and he was found guilty . 
fully informed jury association activists have sometimes handed out educational leaflets inside courthouses despite admonitions not to ; according to fija , many of them have escaped prosecution because `` prosecutors have reasoned -lrb- correctly -rrb- that if they arrest fully informed jury leafleters , the leaflets will have to be given to the leafleter 's own jury as evidence . '' 
along with giving the offender his `` just deserts '' , achieving crime control via incapacitation and deterrence is a major goal of criminal punishment . 
leonard hubert hoffmann writes , `` in deciding whether or not to impose punishment , the most important consideration would be whether it would do more harm than good . 
it is a matter for the state -lrb- including the judges -rrb- to decide on utilitarian grounds whether to do so or not . '' 
brownlee argues , `` bringing in deterrence at the level of justification detracts from the law 's engagement in a moral dialogue with the offender as a rational person because it focuses attention on the threat of punishment and not the moral reasons to follow this law . '' 
construction is the process of constructing a building or infrastructure . 
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . 
construction as an industry comprises six to nine percent of the gross domestic product of developed countries . 
construction starts with planning , -lsb- citation needed -rsb- design , and financing and continues until the project is built and ready for use . 
construction differs from manufacturing in that manufacturing typically involves mass production of similar items without a designated purchaser , while construction typically takes place on location for a known client . 
an architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it . 
an architect normally manages the job , and a construction manager , design engineer , construction engineer or project manager supervises it . 
for the successful execution of a project , effective planning is essential . 
the largest construction projects are referred to as megaprojects . 
those involved with the design and execution of the infrastructure in question must consider zoning requirements , the environmental impact of the job , the successful scheduling , budgeting , construction-site safety , availability and transportation of building materials , logistics , inconvenience to the public caused by construction delays and bidding , etc. . 
in general , there are three sectors of construction : buildings , infrastructure and industrial . 
building construction is usually further divided into residential and non-residential -lrb- commercial/institutional -rrb- . 
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering . 
infrastructure is often called heavy/highway , heavy civil or heavy engineering . 
industrial includes refineries , process chemical , power generation , mills and manufacturing plants . 
engineering news-record -lrb- enr -rrb- is a trade magazine for the construction industry . 
each year , enr compiles and reports on data about the size of design and construction companies . 
in 2014 , enr compiled the data in nine market segments . 
in their reporting on the top 400 , they used data on transportation , sewer , hazardous waste and water to rank firms as heavy contractors . 
to recognize the differences of companies in this sector , it is divided into three subsectors : building construction , heavy and civil engineering construction , and specialty trade contractors . 
there are also categories for construction service firms -lrb- e.g. , engineering , architecture -rrb- and construction managers -lrb- firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project -rrb- . 
the standard industrial classification and the newer north american industry classification system have a classification system for companies that perform or otherwise engage in construction . 
there are also categories for construction service firms -lrb- e.g. , engineering , architecture -rrb- and construction managers -lrb- firms engaged in managing construction projects without assuming direct financial responsibility for completion of the construction project -rrb- . 
building construction is the process of adding structure to real property or construction of buildings . 
the majority of building construction jobs are small renovations , such as addition of a room , or renovation of a bathroom . 
often , the owner of the property acts as laborer , paymaster , and design team for the entire project . 
although building construction projects typically include various common elements , such as design , financial , estimating and legal considerations , many projects of varying sizes reach undesirable end results , such as structural collapse , cost overruns , and/or litigation . 
for this reason , those with experience in the field make detailed plans and maintain careful oversight during the project to ensure a positive outcome . 
residential construction practices , technologies , and resources must conform to local building authority regulations and codes of practice . 
materials readily available in the area generally dictate the construction materials used -lrb- e.g. brick versus stone , versus timber -rrb- . 
as residential construction -lrb- as well as all other types of construction -rrb- can generate a lot of waste , careful planning again is needed here . 
cost of construction on a per square meter -lrb- or per square foot -rrb- basis for houses can vary dramatically based on site conditions , local regulations , economies of scale -lrb- custom designed homes are often more expensive to build -rrb- and the availability of skilled tradespeople . 
new techniques of building construction are being researched , made possible by advances in 3d printing technology . 
in a form of additive building construction , similar to the additive manufacturing techniques for manufactured parts , building printing is making it possible to flexibly construct small commercial buildings and private habitations in around 20 hours , with built-in plumbing and electrical facilities , in one continuous build , using large 3d printers . 
working versions of 3d-printing building technology are already printing 2 metres -lrb- 6 ft 7 in -rrb- of building material per hour as of january 2013 -lsb- update -rsb- , with the next-generation printers capable of 3.5 metres -lrb- 11 ft -rrb- per hour , sufficient to complete a building in a week .

a formal design team may be assembled to plan the physical proceedings , and to integrate those proceedings with the other parts . 
in the modern industrialized world , construction usually involves the translation of designs into reality . 
the design team is most commonly employed by -lrb- i.e. in contract with -rrb- the property owner . 
under this system , once the design is completed by the design team , a number of construction companies or construction management companies may then be asked to make a bid for the work , either based directly on the design , or on the basis of drawings and a bill of quantities provided by a quantity surveyor . 
following evaluation of bids , the owner typically awards a contract to the most cost efficient bidder . 
the modern trend in design is toward integration of previously separated specialties , especially among large firms . 
in the past , architects , interior designers , engineers , developers , construction managers , and general contractors were more likely to be entirely separate companies , even in the larger firms . 
thus , each such firm may offer itself as `` one-stop shopping '' for a construction project , from beginning to end . 
this is designated as a `` design build '' contract where the contractor is given a performance specification and must undertake the project from design to construction , while adhering to the performance specifications . 
several project structures can assist the owner in this integration , including design-build , partnering and construction management . 
in general , each of these project structures allows the owner to integrate the services of architects , interior designers , engineers and constructors throughout design and construction . 
in response , many companies are growing beyond traditional offerings of design or construction services alone and are placing more emphasis on establishing relationships with other necessary participants through the design-build process . 
construction projects can suffer from preventable financial problems . 
underbids happen when builders ask for too little money to complete the project . 
cash flow problems exist when the present amount of funding can not cover the current costs for labour and materials , and because they are a matter of having sufficient funds at a specific time , can arise even when the overall total is enough . 
fraud is a problem in many fields , but is notoriously prevalent in the construction field . 
mortgage bankers , accountants , and cost engineers are likely participants in creating an overall plan for the financial management of the building construction project . 
the presence of the mortgage banker is highly likely , even in relatively small projects since the owner 's equity in the property is the most obvious source of funding for a building project . 
accountants act to study the expected monetary flow over the life of the project and to monitor the payouts throughout the process . 
cost overruns with government projects have occurred when the contractor identified change orders or project changes that increased costs , which are not subject to competition from other firms as they have already been eliminated from consideration after the initial bid . 
cost engineers and estimators apply expertise to relate the work and materials involved to a proper valuation . 
the project must adhere to zoning and building code requirements . 
constructing a project that fails to adhere to codes does not benefit the owner . 
some legal requirements come from malum in se considerations , or the desire to prevent things that are indisputably bad -- bridge collapses or explosions . 
other legal requirements come from malum prohibitum considerations , or things that are a matter of custom or expectation , such as isolating businesses to a business district and residences to a residential district . 
an attorney may seek changes or exemptions in the law that governs the land where the building will be built , either by arguing that a rule is inapplicable -lrb- the bridge design will not cause a collapse -rrb- , or that the custom is no longer needed -lrb- acceptance of live-work spaces has grown in the community -rrb- . 
a construction project is a complex net of contracts and other legal obligations , each of which all parties must carefully consider . 
a contract is the exchange of a set of obligations between two or more parties , but it is not so simple a matter as trying to get the other side to agree to as much as possible in exchange for as little as possible . 
the time element in construction means that a delay costs money , and in cases of bottlenecks , the delay can be extremely expensive . 
thus , the contracts must be designed to ensure that each side is capable of performing the obligations set out . 
contracts that set out clear expectations and clear paths to accomplishing those expectations are far more likely to result in the project flowing smoothly , whereas poorly drafted contracts lead to confusion and collapse . 
there is also a growing number of new forms of procurement that involve relationship contracting where the emphasis is on a co-operative relationship between the principal and contractor and other stakeholders within a construction project . 
new forms include partnering such as public-private partnering -lrb- ppps -rrb- aka private finance initiatives -lrb- pfis -rrb- and alliances such as `` pure '' or `` project '' alliances and `` impure '' or `` strategic '' alliances .

the procedure continues until the building is ready to occupy . 
the owner produces a list of requirements for a project , giving an overall view of the project 's goals . 
several d&b contractors present different ideas about how to accomplish these goals . 
the owner selects the ideas he or she likes best and hires the appropriate contractor . 
often , it is not just one contractor , but a consortium of several contractors working together . 
as they build phase 1 , they design phase 2 . 
before the foundation can be dug , contractors are typically required to verify and have existing utility lines marked , either by the utilities themselves or through a company specializing in such services . 
this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations . 
this lessens the likelihood of damage to the existing electrical , water , sewage , phone , and cable facilities , which could cause outages and potentially hazardous situations . 
during the construction of a building , the municipal building inspector inspects the building periodically to ensure that the construction adheres to the approved plans and the local building code . 
once construction is complete and a final inspection has been passed , an occupancy permit may be issued .

some construction workers in the us/canada have made more than $ 100,000 annually , depending on their trade . 
construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world , incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union . 
falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers . 
other major causes of fatalities in the construction industry include electrocution , transportation accidents , and trench cave-ins . 
proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry . 
private schools , also known as independent schools , non-governmental , or nonstate schools , are not administered by local , state or national governments ; thus , they retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students tuition , rather than relying on mandatory taxation through public -lrb- government -rrb- funding ; at some private schools students may be able to get a scholarship , which makes the cost cheaper , depending on a talent the student may have -lrb- e.g. sport scholarship , art scholarship , academic scholarship -rrb- , financial need , or tax credit scholarships that might be available .

in the united kingdom and several other commonwealth countries including australia and canada , the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels ; it is almost never used of universities and other tertiary institutions . 
private education in north america covers the whole gamut of educational activity , ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions . 
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 -lrb- year twelve is known as lower sixth -rrb- and year 13 -lrb- upper sixth -rrb- . 
the secondary level includes schools offering years 7 through 12 -lrb- year twelve is known as lower sixth -rrb- and year 13 -lrb- upper sixth -rrb- . 
this category includes university-preparatory schools or `` prep schools '' , boarding schools and day schools . 
tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors , including the location of the school , the willingness of parents to pay , peer tuitions and the school 's financial endowment . 
high tuition , schools claim , is used to pay higher salaries for the best teachers and also used to provide enriched learning environments , including a low student to teacher ratio , small class sizes and services , such as libraries , science laboratories and computers . 
they include parochial schools , a term which is often used to denote roman catholic schools . 
other religious groups represented in the k-12 private education sector include protestants , jews , muslims and the orthodox christians . 
some such schools teach religious education , together with the usual academic subjects to impress their particular faith 's beliefs and traditions in the students who attend . 
some schools offer the removal of the purported distractions of co-education ; the presence of boarding facilities ; or stricter discipline based on their power of expulsion , a tool not readily available to government schools . 
student uniforms for australian private schools are generally stricter and more formal than in government schools - for example , a compulsory blazer . 
private schools in australia are always more expensive than their public counterparts . 
although most are non-aligned , some of the best known independent schools also belong to the large , long-established religious foundations , such as the anglican church , uniting church and presbyterian church , but in most cases , they do not insist on their students ' religious allegiance . 
they are usually expensive schools that tend to be up-market and traditional in style , some catholic schools fall into this category as well , e.g. st joseph 's college , gregory terrace , saint ignatius ' college , riverview , st gregory 's college , campbelltown , st aloysius ' college -lrb- sydney -rrb- and st joseph 's college , hunters hill , as well as loreto kirribilli , monte sant angelo mercy college , st ursula 's college and loreto normanhurst for girls .

teachers at ersatzschulen must have at least the same education and at least the same wages as teachers at public schools , an ersatzschule must have at least the same academic standards as a public school and article 7 , paragraph 4 of the grundgesetz , also forbids segregation of pupils according to the means of their parents -lrb- the so-called sonderungsverbot -rrb- . 
ersatzschulen are ordinary primary or secondary schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or religious groups . 
therefore , most ersatzschulen have very low tuition fees and/or offer scholarships , compared to most other western european countries . 
ergänzungsschulen are secondary or post-secondary -lrb- non-tertiary -rrb- schools , which are run by private individuals , private organizations or rarely , religious groups and offer a type of education which is not available at public schools .

in india , private schools are called independent schools , but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government , it can be an aided or an unaided school . 
prominent examination boards that are present in multiple states are the cbse and the cisce , nenbse 
among other things , this has also resulted in 30 different examination boards or academic authorities that conduct examinations for school leaving certificates . 
the practice has been for the union government to provide the broad policy directions while the states create their own rules and regulations for the administration of the sector .

harvard was formed in 1636 by vote of the great and general court of the massachusetts bay colony . 
in 1638 , the college became home for north america 's first known printing press , carried by the ship john of london . 
in 1639 , the college was renamed harvard college after deceased clergyman john harvard , who was an alumnus of the university of cambridge . 
the charter creating the harvard corporation was granted in 1650 . 
in the early years the college trained many puritan ministers . 
it offered a classic curriculum on the english university model -- many leaders in the colony had attended the university of cambridge -- but conformed puritanism . 
it was never affiliated with any particular denomination , but many of its earliest graduates went on to become clergymen in congregational and unitarian churches . 
throughout the 18th century , enlightenment ideas of the power of reason and free will became widespread among congregationalist ministers , putting those ministers and their congregations in tension with more traditionalist , calvinist parties. :1 -- 4 when the hollis professor of divinity david tappan died in 1803 and the president of harvard joseph willard died a year later , in 1804 , a struggle broke out over their replacements . 
henry ware was elected to the chair in 1805 , and the liberal samuel webber was appointed to the presidency of harvard two years later , which signaled the changing of the tide from the dominance of traditional ideas at harvard to the dominance of liberal , arminian ideas -lrb- defined by traditionalists as unitarian ideas -rrb- .

in 1846 , the natural history lectures of louis agassiz were acclaimed both in new york and on the campus at harvard college . 
agassiz 's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the `` divine plan '' in all phenomena . 
this dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of common sense realism derived from scottish philosophers thomas reid and dugald stewart , whose works were part of the harvard curriculum at the time . 
charles w. eliot , president 1869 -- 1909 , eliminated the favored position of christianity from the curriculum while opening it to student self-direction . 
while eliot was the most crucial figure in the secularization of american higher education , he was motivated not by a desire to secularize education , but by transcendentalist unitarian convictions . 
derived from william ellery channing and ralph waldo emerson , these convictions were focused on the dignity and worth of human nature , the right and ability of each person to perceive truth , and the indwelling god in each person . 
james bryant conant -lrb- president , 1933 -- 1953 -rrb- reinvigorated creative scholarship to guarantee its preeminence among research institutions . 
he saw higher education as a vehicle of opportunity for the talented rather than an entitlement for the wealthy , so conant devised programs to identify , recruit , and support talented youth . 
the resulting report , published in 1945 , was one of the most influential manifestos in the history of american education in the 20th century . 
nonetheless , harvard 's undergraduate population remained predominantly male , with about four men attending harvard college for every woman studying at radcliffe .

the color was unofficially adopted -lrb- in preference to magenta -rrb- by an 1875 vote of the student body , although the association with some form of red can be traced back to 1858 , when charles william eliot , a young graduate student who would later become harvard 's 21st and longest-serving president -lrb- 1869 -- 1909 -rrb- , bought red bandanas for his crew so they could more easily be distinguished by spectators at a regatta .

harvard has an intense athletic rivalry with yale university culminating in the game , although the harvard -- yale regatta predates the football game . 
this rivalry , though , is put aside every two years when the harvard and yale track and field teams come together to compete against a combined oxford university and cambridge university team , a competition that is the oldest continuous international amateur competition in the world . 
harvard 's athletic rivalry with yale is intense in every sport in which they meet , coming to a climax each fall in the annual football meeting , which dates back to 1875 and is usually called simply `` the game '' .

over the long-term , this trend increases the organic composition of capital , meaning that less workers are required in proportion to capital inputs , increasing unemployment -lrb- the `` reserve army of labour '' -rrb- .

in a purely capitalist mode of production -lrb- i.e. where professional and labor organizations can not limit the number of workers -rrb- the workers wages will not be controlled by these organizations , or by the employer , but rather by the market . 
under the law of supply and demand , the price of skill is determined by a race between the demand for the skilled worker and the supply of the skilled worker . 
employers who offer a below market wage will find that their business is chronically understaffed . 
their competitors will take advantage of the situation by offering a higher wage the best of their labor . 
`` markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . ''

wages work in the same way as prices for any other good . 
thus , wages can be considered as a function of market price of skill .

`` markets , by themselves , even when they are stable , often lead to high levels of inequality , outcomes that are widely viewed as unfair . '' 
competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job . 
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time -lrb- high supply -rrb- competing for a job that few require -lrb- low demand -rrb- will result in a low wage for that job . 
a job where there are few able or willing workers -lrb- low supply -rrb- , but a large need for the positions -lrb- high demand -rrb- , will result in high wages for that job . 
members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining , political influence , or corruption . 
professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members . 
a job where there are many workers willing to work a large amount of time -lrb- high supply -rrb- competing for a job that few require -lrb- low demand -rrb- will result in a low wage for that job . 
this is because competition between workers drives down the wage .

competition amongst employers tends to drive up wages due to the nature of the job , since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position . 
on the other hand , higher economic inequality tends to increase entrepreneurship rates at the individual level -lrb- self-employment -rrb- . 
necessity-based entrepreneurship is motivated by survival needs such as income for food and shelter -lrb- `` push '' motivations -rrb- , whereas opportunity-based entrepreneurship is driven by achievement-oriented motivations -lrb- `` pull '' -rrb- such as vocation and more likely to involve the pursue of new products , services , or underserved market needs .

the economic impact of the former type of entrepreneurialism tends to be redistributive while the latter is expected to foster technological progress and thus have a more positive impact on economic growth . 
a progressive tax is a tax by which the tax rate increases as the taxable base amount increases . 
in a progressive tax system , the level of the top tax rate will often have a direct impact on the level of inequality within a society , either increasing it or decreasing it , provided that income does not change as a result of the change in tax regime . 
additionally , steeper tax progressivity applied to social spending can result in a more equal distribution of income across the board . 
another cause is the rate at which income is taxed coupled with the progressivity of the tax system .

the difference between the gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation . 
an important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals ' access to education . 
as a result , those who are unable to afford an education , or choose not to pursue optional education , generally receive much lower wages .

conversely , education raises incomes and promotes growth because it helps to unleash the productive potential of the poor . 
the justification for this is that a lack of education leads directly to lower incomes , and thus lower aggregate savings and investment .

eventually , through various possible redistribution mechanisms such as social welfare programs , more developed countries move back to lower levels of inequality . 
according to kuznets , countries with low levels of development have relatively equal distributions of wealth .

economist joseph stiglitz argues that rather than explaining concentrations of wealth and income , market forces should serve as a brake on such concentration , which may better be explained by the non-market force known as `` rent-seeking '' . 
while the market will bid up compensation for rare and desired skills to reward wealth creation , greater productivity , etc. , it will also prevent successful entrepreneurs from earning excess profits by fostering competition to cut prices , profits and large compensation . 
a better explainer of growing inequality , according to stiglitz , is the use of political power generated by wealth by certain groups to shape government policies financially beneficial to them . 
this process , known to economists as rent-seeking , brings income not from creation of wealth but from `` grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort '' 
effects of inequality researchers have found include higher rates of health and social problems , and lower rates of social goods , a lower level of economic utility in society from resources devoted on high-end consumption , and even a lower level of economic growth when human capital is neglected for high-end consumption .

high and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . 
unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . 
policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth .

for most of human history higher material living standards -- full stomachs , access to clean water and warmth from fuel -- led to better health and longer lives . 
this pattern of higher incomes-longer lives still holds among poorer countries , where life expectancy increases rapidly as per capita income increases , but in recent decades it has slowed down among middle income countries and plateaued among the richest thirty or so countries in the world .

the unicef index of `` child well-being in rich countries '' , studying 40 indicators in 22 countries , correlates with greater equality but not per capita income . 
crime rate has also been shown to be correlated with inequality in society . 
most studies looking into the relationship have concentrated on homicides -- since homicides are almost identically defined across all nations and jurisdictions . 
there have been over fifty studies showing tendencies for violence to be more common in societies where income differences are larger . 
they estimated that about half of all variation in homicide rates can be accounted for by differences in the amount of inequality in each province or state . 
daly et al. 2001 found that among u.s states and canadian provinces there is a tenfold difference in homicide rates related to inequality . 
following the utilitarian principle of seeking the greatest good for the greatest number -- economic inequality is problematic . 
a house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a summer home than it would to a homeless family of five , is an example of reduced `` distributive efficiency '' within society , that decreases marginal utility of wealth and thus the sum total of personal utility . 
an additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person , such as basic necessities like food , water , and healthcare ; while , an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person . 
thus , the marginal utility of wealth per person -lrb- `` the additional dollar '' -rrb- decreases as a person becomes richer . 
from this standpoint , for any given amount of wealth in society , a society with more equality will have higher aggregate utility . 
conservative researchers have argued that income inequality is not significant because consumption , rather than income should be the measure of inequality , and inequality of consumption is less extreme than inequality of income in the us . 
will wilkinson of the libertarian cato institute states that `` the weight of the evidence shows that the run-up in consumption inequality has been considerably less dramatic than the rise in income inequality , '' and consumption is more important than income . 
according to johnson , smeeding , and tory , consumption inequality was actually lower in 2001 than it was in 1986 .

according to international monetary fund economists , inequality in wealth and income is negatively correlated with the duration of economic growth spells -lrb- not the rate of growth -rrb- . 
high levels of inequality prevent not just economic prosperity , but also the quality of a country 's institutions and high levels of education . 
according to imf staff economists , `` if the income share of the top 20 percent -lrb- the rich -rrb- increases , then gdp growth actually declines over the medium term , suggesting that the benefits do not trickle down . 
in contrast , an increase in the income share of the bottom 20 percent -lrb- the poor -rrb- is associated with higher gdp growth . 
the poor and the middle class matter the most for growth via a number of interrelated economic , social , and political channels . '' 
according to economists david castells-quintana and vicente royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth . 
according to economists david castells-quintana and vicente royuela , increasing inequality harms economic growth . 
high and persistent unemployment , in which inequality increases , has a negative effect on subsequent long-run economic growth . 
unemployment can harm growth not only because it is a waste of resources , but also because it generates redistributive pressures and subsequent distortions , drives people to poverty , constrains liquidity limiting labor mobility , and erodes self-esteem promoting social dislocation , unrest and conflict . 
policies aiming at controlling unemployment and in particular at reducing its inequality-associated effects support economic growth . 
economist joseph stiglitz presented evidence in 2009 that both global inequality and inequality within countries prevent growth by limiting aggregate demand .

economist branko milanovic , wrote in 2001 that , `` the view that income inequality harms growth -- or that improved equality can help sustain growth -- has become more widely held in recent years . 
... the main reason for this shift is the increasing importance of human capital in development . 
but now that human capital is scarcer than machines , widespread education has become the secret to growth . '' 
in 1993 , galor and zeira showed that inequality in the presence of credit market imperfections has a long lasting detrimental effect on human capital formation and economic development .

a 1996 study by perotti examined the channels through which inequality may affect economic growth . 
he found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation , which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment . 
also , very unequal societies tend to be politically and socially unstable , which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth . '' 
according to work by barro in 1999 and 2000 , high levels of inequality reduce growth in relatively poor countries but encourage growth in richer countries .

a study of swedish counties between 1960 and 2000 found a positive impact of inequality on growth with lead times of five years or less , but no correlation after ten years . 
studies on income inequality and growth have sometimes found evidence confirming the kuznets curve hypothesis , which states that with economic development , inequality first increases , then decreases .

some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development . 
according to a 1955 review , savings by the wealthy , if these increase with inequality , were thought to offset reduced consumer demand . 
a 2013 report on nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality . 
analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth . 
developing countries with high inequality have `` succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years '' but `` longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution . '' 
while acknowledging the central role economic growth can potentially play in human development , poverty reduction and the achievement of the millennium development goals , it is becoming widely understood amongst the development community that special efforts must be made to ensure poorer sections of society are able to participate in economic growth . 
the effect of economic growth on poverty reduction -- the growth elasticity of poverty -- can depend on the existing level of inequality . 
for instance , with low inequality a country with a growth rate of 2 % per head and 40 % of its population living in poverty , can halve poverty in ten years , but a country with high inequality would take nearly 60 years to achieve the same reduction . 
in the words of the secretary general of the united nations ban ki-moon : `` while economic growth is necessary , it is not sufficient for progress on reducing poverty . ''

in many poor and developing countries much land and housing is held outside the formal or legal property ownership registration system . 
much unregistered property is held in informal form through various associations and other arrangements . 
reasons for extra-legal ownership include excessive bureaucratic red tape in buying property and building , in some countries it can take over 200 steps and up to 14 years to build on government land .

a number of researchers -lrb- david rodda , jacob vigdor , and janna matlack -rrb- , argue that a shortage of affordable housing -- at least in the us -- is caused in part by income inequality . 
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased -lrb- rhoda 1994:148 -rrb- . 
david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 , the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased -lrb- rhoda 1994:148 -rrb- . 
through gentrification of older neighbourhoods , for example , in east new york , rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units . 
the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace . 
firstly , certain costs are difficult to avoid and are shared by everyone , such as the costs of housing , pensions , education and health care . 
if the state does not provide these services , then for those on lower incomes , the costs must be borrowed and often those on lower incomes are those who are worse equipped to manage their finances . 
secondly , aspirational consumption describes the process of middle income earners aspiring to achieve the standards of living enjoyed by their wealthier counterparts and one method of achieving this aspiration is by taking on debt .

the result leads to even greater inequality and potential economic instability . 
the smaller the economic inequality , the more waste and pollution is created , resulting in many cases , in more environmental degradation . 
also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier .

if -lrb- as wwf argued -rrb- , population levels would start to drop to a sustainable level -lrb- 1/3 of current levels , so about 2 billion people -rrb- , human inequality can be addressed/corrected , while still not resulting in an increase of environmental damage . 
socialists attribute the vast disparities in wealth to the private ownership of the means of production by a class of owners , creating a situation where a small portion of the population lives off unearned property income by virtue of ownership titles in capital equipment , financial assets and corporate stock .

by contrast , the vast majority of the population is dependent on income in the form of a wage or salary . 
in order to rectify this situation , socialists argue that the means of production should be socially owned so that income differentials would be reflective of individual contributions to the social product .

robert nozick argued that government redistributes wealth by force -lrb- usually in the form of taxation -rrb- , and that the ideal moral society would be one where all individuals are free from force . 
however , nozick recognized that some modern economic inequalities were the result of forceful taking of property , and a certain amount of redistribution would be justified to compensate for this force but not because of the inequalities themselves . 
john rawls argued in a theory of justice that inequalities in the distribution of wealth are only justified when they improve society as a whole , including the poorest members . 
the capabilities approach -- sometimes called the human development approach -- looks at income inequality and poverty as form of `` capability deprivation '' . 
unlike neoliberalism , which `` defines well-being as utility maximization '' , economic growth and income are considered a means to an end rather than the end itself . 
its goal is to `` wid -lsb- en -rsb- people 's choices and the level of their achieved well-being '' through increasing functionings -lrb- the things a person values doing -rrb- , capabilities -lrb- the freedom to enjoy functionings -rrb- and agency -lrb- the ability to pursue valued goals -rrb- .

when a person 's capabilities are lowered , they are in some way deprived of earning as much income as they would otherwise . 
an old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home . 
an old , ill man can not earn as much as a healthy young man ; gender roles and customs may prevent a woman from receiving an education or working outside the home . 
there may be an epidemic that causes widespread panic , or there could be rampant violence in the area that prevents people from going to work for fear of their lives . 
to prevent such inequality , this approach believes it 's important to have political freedom , economic facilities , social opportunities , transparency guarantees , and protective security to ensure that people are n't denied their functionings , capabilities , and agency and can thus work towards a better relevant income .

although the mongols had ruled territories including today 's north china for decades , it was not until 1271 that kublai khan officially proclaimed the dynasty in the traditional chinese style . 
the yuan dynasty is considered both a successor to the mongol empire and an imperial chinese dynasty . 
in official chinese histories , the yuan dynasty bore the mandate of heaven , following the song dynasty and preceding the ming dynasty . 
in official chinese histories , the yuan dynasty bore the mandate of heaven , following the song dynasty and preceding the ming dynasty . 
the dynasty was established by kublai khan , yet he placed his grandfather genghis khan on the imperial records as the official founder of the dynasty as taizu . 
in 1271 , kublai khan imposed the name great yuan -lrb- chinese : 大元 ; pinyin : dà yuán ; wade -- giles : ta-yüan -rrb- , establishing the yuan dynasty . 
`` dà yuán '' -lrb- 大元 -rrb- is from the sentence '' 大哉乾元 '' -lrb- dà zai qián yuán / `` great is qián , the primal '' -rrb- in the commentaries on the classic of changes -lrb- i ching -rrb- section regarding qián -lrb- 乾 -rrb- . 
the counterpart in mongolian language was dai ön ulus , also rendered as ikh yuan üls or yekhe yuan ulus . 
`` great mongol state '' -rrb- , resulting in dai ön yeke mongghul ulus -lrb- mongolian script : -rrb- , meaning `` great yuan great mongol state '' . 
furthermore , the yuan is sometimes known as the `` empire of the great khan '' or `` khanate of the great khan '' , which particularly appeared on some yuan maps , since yuan emperors held the nominal title of great khan . 
genghis khan united the mongol and turkic tribes of the steppes and became great khan in 1206 .

under the reign of genghis ' third son , ögedei khan , the mongols destroyed the weakened jin dynasty in 1234 , conquering most of northern china . 
möngke khan succeeded ögedei 's son , güyük , as great khan in 1251 . 
ögedei offered his nephew kublai a position in xingzhou , hebei . 
many han chinese and khitan defected to the mongols to fight against the jin . 
two han chinese leaders , shi tianze , liu heima -lrb- 劉黑馬 , liu ni -rrb- , and the khitan xiao zhala -lrb- 蕭札剌 -rrb- defected and commanded the 3 tumens in the mongol army .

he died in 1259 without a successor . 
kublai returned from fighting the song in 1260 when he learned that his brother , ariq böke , was challenging his claim to the throne . 
he bolstered his popularity among his subjects by modeling his government on the bureaucracy of traditional chinese dynasties and adopting the chinese era name of zhongtong . 
ogedei 's grandson kaidu refused to submit to kublai and threatened the western frontier of kublai 's domain . 
the hostile but weakened song dynasty remained an obstacle in the south . 
kublai secured the northeast border in 1259 by installing the hostage prince wonjong as the ruler of korea , making it a mongol tributary state .

li tan , the son-in-law of a powerful official , instigated a revolt against mongol rule in 1262 . 
kublai 's government after 1262 was a compromise between preserving mongol interests in china and satisfying the demands of his chinese subjects . 
he restored the imperial secretariat and left the local administrative structure of past chinese dynasties unchanged . 
however , kublai rejected plans to revive the confucian imperial examinations and divided yuan society into three , later four , classes with the han chinese occupying the lowest rank .

he instituted the reforms proposed by his chinese advisers by centralizing the bureaucracy , expanding the circulation of paper money , and maintaining the traditional monopolies on salt and iron . 
kublai readied the move of the mongol capital from karakorum in mongolia to khanbaliq in 1264 , constructing a new city near the former jurchen capital zhongdu , now modern beijing , in 1266 .

khublai evoked his public image as a sage emperor by following the rituals of confucian propriety and ancestor veneration , while simultaneously retaining his roots as a leader from the steppes . 
kublai khan promoted commercial , scientific , and cultural growth . 
pax mongolica , mongol peace , enabled the spread of technologies , commodities , and culture between china and the west .

confucius 's descendants in quzhou alone number 30,000 . 
after strengthening his government in northern china , kublai pursued an expansionist policy in line with the tradition of mongol and chinese imperialism .

the fourth yuan emperor , buyantu khan -lrb- ayurbarwada -rrb- , was a competent emperor . 
he was the first yuan emperor to actively support and adopt mainstream chinese culture after the reign of kublai , to the discontent of some mongol elite . 
he had been mentored by li meng , a confucian academic . 
he made many reforms , including the liquidation of the department of state affairs -lrb- chinese : 尚書省 -rrb- , which resulted in the execution of five of the highest-ranking officials . 
starting in 1313 the traditional imperial examinations were reintroduced for prospective officials , testing their knowledge on significant historical works . 
emperor gegeen khan , ayurbarwada 's son and successor , ruled for only two years , from 1321 to 1323 . 
emperor gegeen khan , ayurbarwada 's son and successor , ruled for only two years , from 1321 to 1323 . 
he continued his father 's policies to reform the government based on the confucian principles , with the help of his newly appointed grand chancellor baiju . 
during his reign , the da yuan tong zhi -lrb- chinese : 大元通制 , `` the comprehensive institutions of the great yuan '' -rrb- , a huge collection of codes and regulations of the yuan dynasty begun by his father , was formally promulgated . 
gegeen was assassinated in a coup involving five princes from a rival faction , perhaps steppe elite opposed to confucian reforms . 
when yesün temür died in shangdu in 1328 , tugh temür was recalled to khanbaliq by the qipchaq commander el temür . 
gaining support from princes and officers in northern china and some other parts of the dynasty , khanbaliq-based tugh temür eventually won the civil war against ragibagh known as the war of the two capitals . 
however , kusala suddenly died only four days after a banquet with tugh temür . 
he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür , and tugh temür then remounted the throne . 
he was supposedly killed with poison by el temür , and tugh temür then remounted the throne . 
due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by el temür , tugh temür is known for his cultural contribution instead . 
his most concrete effort to patronize chinese learning was founding the academy of the pavilion of the star of literature -lrb- chinese : 奎章閣學士院 -rrb- , first established in the spring of 1329 and designed to undertake `` a number of tasks relating to the transmission of confucian high culture to the mongolian imperial establishment '' .

the academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books , but its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named jingshi dadian -lrb- chinese : 經世大典 -rrb- . 
tugh temür supported zhu xi 's neo-confucianism and also devoted himself in buddhism . 
after the death of tugh temür in 1332 and subsequent death of rinchinbal -lrb- emperor ningzong -rrb- the same year , the 13-year-old toghun temür -lrb- emperor huizong -rrb- , the last of the nine successors of kublai khan , was summoned back from guangxi and succeeded to the throne .

one of his successful projects was to finish the long-stalled official histories of the liao , jin , and song dynasties , which were eventually completed in 1345 . 
the final years of the yuan dynasty were marked by struggle , famine , and bitterness among the populace . 
in time , kublai khan 's successors lost all influence on other mongol lands across asia , while the mongols beyond the middle kingdom saw them as too chinese . 
uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and china was torn by dissension and unrest . 
outlaws ravaged the country without interference from the weakening yuan armies . 
uninterested in administration , they were separated from both the army and the populace , and china was torn by dissension and unrest . 
from the late 1340s onwards , people in the countryside suffered from frequent natural disasters such as droughts , floods and the resulting famines , and the government 's lack of effective policy led to a loss of popular support . 
in 1351 , the red turban rebellion started and grew into a nationwide uprising . 
in 1354 , when toghtogha led a large army to crush the red turban rebels , toghun temür suddenly dismissed him for fear of betrayal .

he fled north to shangdu from khanbaliq -lrb- present-day beijing -rrb- in 1368 after the approach of the forces of the míng dynasty -lrb- 1368 -- 1644 -rrb- , founded by zhu yuanzhang in the south . 
the political unity of china and much of central asia promoted trade between east and west . 
the mongols ' extensive west asian and european contacts produced a fair amount of cultural exchange . 
it had significantly eased trade and commerce across asia until its decline ; the communications between yuan dynasty and its ally and subordinate in persia , the ilkhanate , encouraged this development . 
eastern crops such as carrots , turnips , new varieties of lemons , eggplants , and melons , high-quality granulated sugar , and cotton were all either introduced or successfully popularized during the yuan dynasty . 
western musical instruments were introduced to enrich chinese performing arts . 
nestorianism and roman catholicism also enjoyed a period of toleration . 
buddhism -lrb- especially tibetan buddhism -rrb- flourished , although taoism endured certain persecutions in favor of buddhism from the yuan government . 
confucian governmental practices and examinations based on the classics , which had fallen into disuse in north china during the period of disunity , were reinstated by the yuan court , probably in the hope of maintaining order over han society . 
advances were realized in the fields of travel literature , cartography , geography , and scientific education . 
the most famous traveler of the period was the venetian marco polo , whose account of his trip to `` cambaluc , '' the capital of the great khan , and of life there astounded the people of europe .

among kublai khan 's top engineers and scientists was the astronomer guo shoujing , who was tasked with many public works projects and helped the yuan reform the lunisolar calendar to provide an accuracy of 365.2425 days of the year , which was only 26 seconds off the modern gregorian calendar 's measurement .

to provide against possible famines , granaries were ordered built throughout the empire . 
during the yuan period , beijing became the terminus of the grand canal of china , which was completely renovated . 
contacts with the west also brought the introduction to china of a major food crop , sorghum , along with other foreign food products and methods of preparation . 
the yuan dynasty was the first time that non-native chinese people ruled all of china . 
mongols are widely known to worship the eternal heaven , and according to the traditional mongolian ideology yuan is considered to be `` the beginning of an infinite number of beings , the foundation of peace and happiness , state power , the dream of many peoples , besides it there is nothing great or precious . '' 
in traditional historiography of china , on the other hand , the yuan dynasty is usually considered to be the legitimate dynasty between the song dynasty and the ming dynasty .

who did not consider the yuan dynasty as a legitimate dynasty of china , but rather as a period of foreign domination . 
the system of bureaucracy created by kublai khan reflected various cultures in the empire , including that of the han chinese , khitans , jurchens , mongols , and tibetan buddhists . 
the chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native tang , song , as well as khitan liao and jurchen jin dynasties . 
chinese advisers such as liu bingzhong and yao shu gave strong influence to kublai 's early court , and the central government administration was established within the first decade of kublai 's reign . 
this government adopted the traditional chinese tripartite division of authority among civil , military , and censorial offices , including the central secretariat -lrb- zhongshu sheng -rrb- to manage civil affairs , the privy council -lrb- chinese : 樞密院 -rrb- to manage military affairs , and the censorate to conduct internal surveillance and inspection .

another example was the insignificance of the ministry of war compared with native chinese dynasties , as the real military authority in yuan times resided in the privy council . 
while the existence of these central government departments and the six ministries -lrb- which had been introduced since the sui and tang dynasties -rrb- gave a sinicized image in the yuan administration , the actual functions of these ministries also reflected how mongolian priorities and policies reshaped and redirected those institutions . 
for example , the authority of the yuan legal system , the ministry of justice , did not extend to legal cases involving mongols and semuren , who had separate courts of justice . 
another example was the insignificance of the ministry of war compared with native chinese dynasties , as the real military authority in yuan times resided in the privy council . 
since its invention in 1269 , the ` phags-pa script , a unified script for spelling mongolian , tibetan , and chinese languages , was preserved in the court until the end of the dynasty .

most of the emperors could not master written chinese , but they could generally converse well in the language . 
the mongol custom of long standing quda/marriage alliance with mongol clans , the onggirat , and the ikeres , kept the imperial blood purely mongol until the reign of tugh temur , whose mother was a tangut concubine . 
nevertheless , a few other yuan emperors actively sponsored cultural activities ; an example is tugh temur -lrb- emperor wenzong -rrb- , who wrote poetry , painted , read chinese classical texts , and ordered the compilation of books . 
the mongols practiced debt slavery , and by 1290 in all parts of the mongol empire commoners were selling their children into slavery . 
seeing this as damaging to the mongol nation , kublai in 1291 forbade the sale abroad of mongols . 
the average mongol garrison family of the yuan dynasty seems to have lived a life of decaying rural leisure , with income from the harvests of their chinese tenants eaten up by costs of equipping and dispatching men for their tours of duty . 
in the china of the yuan , or mongol era , various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development , including the areas of painting , mathematics , calligraphy , poetry , and theater , with many great artists and writers being famous today . 
due to the coming together of painting , poetry , and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals , though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others . 
often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting , poetry , and calligraphy , the song dynasty and the yuan dynasty are linked together . 
in yuan poetry , the main development was the qu , which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous yuan poets . 
one of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form . 
however , unlike the western khanates , the yuan dynasty never converted to islam . 
instead , kublai khan , the founder of the yuan dynasty , favored buddhism , especially the tibetan variants . 
as a result , tibetan buddhism was established as the de facto state religion . 
the top-level department and government agency known as the bureau of buddhist and tibetan affairs -lrb- xuanzheng yuan -rrb- was set up in khanbaliq -lrb- modern beijing -rrb- to supervise buddhist monks throughout the empire . 
since kublai khan only esteemed the sakya sect of tibetan buddhism , other religions became less important .

healers were divided into non-mongol physicians called otachi and traditional mongol shamans . 
the mongols characterized otachi doctors by their use of herbal remedies , which was distinguished from the spiritual cures of mongol shamanism .

kublai created the imperial academy of medicine to manage medical treatises and the education of new doctors . 
confucian scholars were attracted to the medical profession because it ensured a high income and medical ethics were compatible with confucian virtues . 
all four schools were based on the same intellectual foundation , but advocated different theoretical approaches toward medicine . 
the chinese medical tradition of the yuan had `` four great schools '' that the yuan inherited from the jin dynasty . 
chinese physicians were brought along military campaigns by the mongols as they expanded towards the west . 
chinese medical techniques such as acupuncture , moxibustion , pulse diagnosis , and various herbal drugs and elixirs were transmitted westward to the middle east and the rest of the empire . 
the physician wei yilin -lrb- 1277 -- 1347 -rrb- invented a suspension method for reducing dislocated joints , which he performed using anesthetics . 
western medicine was also practiced in china by the nestorian christians of the yuan court , where it was sometimes labeled as huihui or muslim medicine .

the publication of a taoist text inscribed with the name of töregene khatun , ögedei 's wife , is one of the first printed works sponsored by the mongols . 
in 1273 , the mongols created the imperial library directorate , a government-sponsored printing office . 
one of the more notable applications of printing technology was the chao , the paper money of the yuan .

although the traditional chinese elite were not given their share of power , the mongols and the semuren -lrb- various allied groups from central asia and the western end of the empire -rrb- largely remained strangers to the mainstream chinese culture , and this dichotomy gave the yuan regime a somewhat strong `` colonial '' coloration .

in general there were very few north chinese or southerners reaching the highest-post in the government compared with the possibility that persians did so in the ilkhanate . 
at the same time the mongols imported central asian muslims to serve as administrators in china , the mongols also sent han chinese and khitans from china to serve as administrators over the muslim population in bukhara in central asia , using foreigners to curtail the power of the local peoples of both lands .

the ming founder zhu yuanzhang had muslim generals like lan yu who rebelled against the mongols and defeated them in combat . 
some muslim communities had a chinese surname which meant `` barracks '' and could also mean `` thanks '' . 
the muslims in the semu class also revolted against the yuan dynasty in the ispah rebellion but the rebellion was crushed and the muslims were massacred by the yuan loyalist commander chen youding . 
the historian frederick w. mote wrote that the usage of the term `` social classes '' for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth , but just entailed `` degrees of privilege '' to which they were entitled institutionally and legally , so a person 's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing , since there were rich and well socially standing chinese while there were less rich mongol and semu than there were mongol and semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated .

the earlier they surrendered to the mongols , the higher they were placed , the more the held out , the lower they were ranked . 
major commerce during this era gave rise to favorable conditions for private southern chinese manufacturers and merchants . 
when the mongols placed the uighurs of the kingdom of qocho over the koreans at the court the korean king objected , then the mongol emperor kublai khan rebuked the korean king , saying that the uighur king of qocho was ranked higher than the karluk kara-khanid ruler , who in turn was ranked higher than the korean king , who was ranked last , because the uighurs surrendered to the mongols first , the karluks surrendered after the uighurs , and the koreans surrendered last , and that the uighurs surrendered peacefully without violently resisting .

its capital and largest city is nairobi . 
it is bordered by tanzania to the south , uganda to the west , south sudan to the north-west , ethiopia to the north and somalia to the north-east . 
kenya covers 581,309 km2 -lrb- 224,445 sq mi -rrb- , and had a population of approximately 45 million people in july 2014 . 
kenya has a warm and humid tropical climate on its indian ocean coastline . 
the climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city , nairobi , and especially closer to mount kenya , which has snow permanently on its peaks . 
the climate is cooler in the savannah grasslands around the capital city , nairobi , and especially closer to mount kenya , which has snow permanently on its peaks . 
the north-eastern regions along the border with somalia and ethiopia are arid and semi-arid areas with near-desert landscapes . 
kenya is known for its safaris , diverse climate and geography , and expansive wildlife reserves and national parks such as the east and west tsavo national park , the maasai mara , lake nakuru national park , and aberdares national park . 
the african great lakes region , which kenya is a part of , has been inhabited by humans since the lower paleolithic period . 
by the first millennium ad , the bantu expansion had reached the area from west-central africa . 
bantu and nilotic populations together constitute around 97 % of the nation 's residents . 
european and arab presence in coastal mombasa dates to the early modern period ; european exploration of the interior began in the 19th century . 
kenya obtained independence in december 1963 . 
the republic of kenya is named after mount kenya . 
the origin of the name kenya is not clear , but perhaps linked to the kikuyu , embu and kamba words kirinyaga , kirenyaa and kiinyaa which mean `` god 's resting place '' in all three languages .

ludwig krapf recorded the name as both kenia and kegnia believed by most to be a corruption of the kamba version . 
others say that this was -- on the contrary -- a very precise notation of a correct african pronunciation / ˈkɛnjə / .

the annual animal migration occurs between june and september with millions of animals taking part , attracting valuable foreign tourism . 
two million wildebeest migrate a distance of 2,900 kilometres -lrb- 1,802 mi -rrb- from the serengeti in neighbouring tanzania to the masai mara in kenya , in a constant clockwise fashion , searching for food and water supplies . 
fossils found in kenya suggest that primates roamed the area more than 20 million years ago . 
recent findings near lake turkana indicate that hominids such as homo habilis -lrb- 1.8 and 2.5 million years ago -rrb- and homo erectus -lrb- 1.8 million to 350,000 years ago -rrb- are possible direct ancestors of modern homo sapiens , and lived in kenya in the pleistocene epoch . 
during excavations at lake turkana in 1984 , paleoanthropologist richard leakey assisted by kamoya kimeu discovered the turkana boy , a 1.6-million-year-old fossil belonging to homo erectus .

the swahili built mombasa into a major port city and established trade links with other nearby city-states , as well as commercial centres in persia , arabia , and even india . 
by the 15th-century , portuguese voyager duarte barbosa claimed that `` mombasa is a place of great traffic and has a good harbour in which there are always moored small craft of many kinds and also great ships , both of which are bound from sofala and others which come from cambay and melinde and others which sail to the island of zanzibar . '' 
throughout the centuries , the kenyan coast has played host to many merchants and explorers . 
among the cities that line the kenyan coast is the city of malindi . 
it has remained an important swahili settlement since the 14th century and once rivalled mombasa for dominance in the african great lakes region .

lt col paul von lettow-vorbeck took command of the german military forces , determined to tie down as many british resources as possible . 
completely cut off from germany , von lettow conducted an effective guerrilla warfare campaign , living off the land , capturing british supplies , and remaining undefeated . 
he eventually surrendered in northern rhodesia -lrb- today zambia -rrb- fourteen days after the armistice was signed in 1918 . 
the central highlands were already home to over a million members of the kikuyu people , most of whom had no land claims in european terms and lived as itinerant farmers .

to protect their interests , the settlers banned the growing of coffee , introduced a hut tax , and the landless were granted less and less land in exchange for their labour . 
there were 80,000 white settlers living in kenya in the 1950s .

operation anvil opened on 24 april 1954 , after weeks of planning by the army with the approval of the war council . 
by the end of the emergency , the home guard had killed 4,686 mau mau , amounting to 42 % of the total insurgents . 
the most important of these was the swynnerton plan , which was used to both reward loyalists and punish mau mau . 
the first direct elections for native kenyans to the legislative council took place in 1957 . 
despite british hopes of handing power to `` moderate '' local rivals , it was the kenya african national union -lrb- kanu -rrb- of jomo kenyatta that formed a government . 
the colony of kenya and the protectorate of kenya each came to an end on 12 december 1963 with independence being conferred on all of kenya . 
in this way , kenya became an independent country under the kenya independence act 1963 of the united kingdom . 
exactly 12 months later on 12 december 1964 , kenya became a republic under the name `` republic of kenya '' . 
the election held in 1988 saw the advent of the mlolongo -lrb- queuing -rrb- system , where voters were supposed to line up behind their favoured candidates instead of a secret ballot . 
this was seen as the climax of a very undemocratic regime and it led to widespread agitation for constitutional reform . 
in democratic , multiparty elections in 1992 and 1997 , daniel arap moi won re-election . 
kenya is a presidential representative democratic republic . 
the president is both the head of state and head of government , and of a multi-party system . 
executive power is exercised by the government . 
legislative power is vested in both the government and the national assembly and the senate . 
the judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature .

in 2012 , the nation placed 139th out of 176 total countries in the cpi , with a score of 27/100 . 
however , there are several rather significant developments with regards to curbing corruption from the kenyan government , for instance , the establishment of a new and independent ethics and anti-corruption commission -lrb- eacc -rrb- .

in the presidential elections , president kibaki under the party of national unity ran for re-election against the main opposition party , the orange democratic movement -lrb- odm -rrb- . 
as the eck continued to count the votes , kibaki closed the gap and then overtook his opponent by a substantial margin after votes from his stronghold arrived later . 
this led to protests and open discrediting of the eck for complicity and to odinga declaring himself the `` people 's president '' and calling for a recount . 
since the election riots , the government and civil society organisations started programmes to avoid similar disasters in the future , said agnes r. m. aboum -- executive director of taabco research and development consultants in nairobi -- in the magazine d+c development and cooperation . 
for example , the truth , justice and reconciliation commission initiated community dialogues , the evangelical lutheran church in kenya started peace meetings and the kenya national dialogue and reconciliation process was started .

after debates , it was passed by parliament , the coalition would hold until the end of the current parliament or if either of the parties withdraws from the deal before then . 
the new office of the pm will have power and authority to co-ordinate and supervise the functions of the government and will be occupied by an elected mp who will be the leader of the party or coalition with majority members in parliament .

on 29 february 2008 , representatives of pnu and odm began working on the finer details of the power-sharing agreement . 
the deal brought kibaki 's pnu and odinga 's odm together and heralded the formation of the grand coalition , in which the two political parties would share power equally . 
a constitutional change was considered that would eliminate the position of prime minister and simultaneously reduce the powers of the president . 
a referendum to vote on the proposed constitution was held on 4 august 2010 , and the new constitution passed by a wide margin . 
among other things , the new constitution delegates more power to local governments and gives kenyans a bill of rights . 
it was promulgated on 27 august 2010 at a euphoric ceremony in nairobi 's uhuru park , accompanied by a 21-gun salute . 
as of that day , the new constitution heralding the second republic came into force .

in july 2015 obama visited kenya , as the first american president to visit the country while in office . 
the armed forces are regularly deployed in peacekeeping missions around the world . 
further , in the aftermath of the national elections of december 2007 and the violence that subsequently engulfed the country , a commission of inquiry , the waki commission , commended its readiness and adjudged it to `` have performed its duty well . '' 
nevertheless , there have been serious allegations of human rights violations , most recently while conducting counter-insurgency operations in the mt elgon area and also in the district of mandera central . 
kenya 's armed forces , like many government institutions in the country , have been tainted by corruption allegations . 
because the operations of the armed forces have been traditionally cloaked by the ubiquitous blanket of `` state security '' , the corruption has been less in public view , and thus less subject to public scrutiny and notoriety . 
in what are by kenyan standards unprecedented revelations , in 2010 , credible claims of corruption were made with regard to recruitment and procurement of armoured personnel carriers . 
further , the wisdom and prudence of certain decisions of procurement have been publicly questioned .

as of 2005 , 17.7 % of kenyans lived on less than $ 1.25 a day . 
kenya is usually classified as a frontier market or occasionally an emerging market , but it is not one of the least developed countries .

kenya 's services sector , which contributes 61 % of gdp , is dominated by tourism . 
the tourism sector has exhibited steady growth in most years since independence and by the late 1980s had become the country 's principal source of foreign exchange . 
tourists , the largest number being from germany and the united kingdom , are attracted mainly to the coastal beaches and the game reserves , notably , the expansive east and west tsavo national park 20,808 square kilometres -lrb- 8,034 sq mi -rrb- in the southeast .

in 2005 agriculture , including forestry and fishing , accounted for 24 % of gdp , as well as for 18 % of wage employment and 50 % of revenue from exports . 
the principal cash crops are tea , horticultural produce , and coffee . 
agriculture is the second largest contributor to kenya 's gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , after the service sector . 
the production of major food staples such as corn is subject to sharp weather-related fluctuations . 
a consortium led by the international crops research institute for the semi-arid tropics -lrb- icrisat -rrb- has had some success in helping farmers grow new pigeon pea varieties , instead of maize , in particularly dry areas . 
pigeon peas are very drought resistant , so can be grown in areas with less than 650 mm annual rainfall . 
successive projects encouraged the commercialisation of legumes , by stimulating the growth of local seed production and agro-dealer networks for distribution and marketing . 
this work , which included linking producers to wholesalers , helped to increase local producer prices by 20 -- 25 % in nairobi and mombasa . 
the commercialisation of the pigeon pea is now enabling some farmers to buy assets , ranging from mobile phones to productive land and livestock , and is opening pathways for them to move out of poverty . 
tea , coffee , sisal , pyrethrum , corn , and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands , one of the most successful agricultural production regions in africa . 
tea , coffee , sisal , pyrethrum , corn , and wheat are grown in the fertile highlands , one of the most successful agricultural production regions in africa . 
livestock predominates in the semi-arid savanna to the north and east . 
unfortunately , the country has not attained the level of investment and efficiency in agriculture that can guarantee food security and coupled with resulting poverty -lrb- 53 % of the population lives below the poverty line -rrb- , a significant portion of the population regularly starves and is heavily dependent on food aid . 
this was last seen in august and september 2011 prompting the kenyans for kenya initiative by the red cross . 
although kenya is the most industrially developed country in the african great lakes region , manufacturing still accounts for only 14 % of the gdp . 
although kenya is the most industrially developed country in the african great lakes region , manufacturing still accounts for only 14 % of the gdp . 
industrial activity , concentrated around the three largest urban centres , nairobi , mombasa and kisumu , is dominated by food-processing industries such as grain milling , beer production , and sugarcane crushing , and the fabrication of consumer goods , e.g. , vehicles from kits . 
in addition , a substantial and expanding informal sector commonly referred to as jua kali engages in small-scale manufacturing of household goods , motor-vehicle parts , and farm implements . 
kenya 's inclusion among the beneficiaries of the us government 's african growth and opportunity act -lrb- agoa -rrb- has given a boost to manufacturing in recent years . 
since agoa took effect in 2000 , kenya 's clothing sales to the united states increased from us$ 44 million to us$ 270 million -lrb- 2006 -rrb- . 
the largest share of kenya 's electricity supply comes from hydroelectric stations at dams along the upper tana river , as well as the turkwel gorge dam in the west .

the state-owned kenya electricity generating company -lrb- kengen -rrb- , established in 1997 under the name of kenya power company , handles the generation of electricity , while kenya power handles the electricity transmission and distribution system in the country . 
kenya has proven deposits of oil in turkana and the commercial viability was just discovered . 
tullow oil estimates kenya 's oil reserves to be around 10 billion barrels . 
exploration is still continuing to determine if there are more reserves . 
petroleum accounts for 20 % to 25 % of the national import bill .

sizeable minorities of other faiths do exist -lrb- muslim 11.2 % , indigenous beliefs 1.7 % -rrb- , and nonreligious 2.4 % . 
sixty percent of the muslim population lives in kenya 's coastal region , comprising 50 % of the total population there . 
western areas of the coast region are mostly christian . 
in addition , there is a large hindu population in kenya -lrb- around 300,000 -rrb- , who have played a key role in the local economy ; they are mostly of indian origin . 
nurses treat 80 % of the population who visit dispensaries , health centres and private clinics in rural and under-served urban areas . 
complicated cases are referred to clinical officers , medical officers and medical practitioners .

the commission focused on identity and unity , which were critical issues at the time . 
between 1964 and 1985 , the 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 system was adopted -- seven years of primary , four years of lower secondary , two years of upper secondary , and three years of university . 
in 1981 , the presidential working party on the second university was commissioned to look at both the possibilities of setting up a second university in kenya as well as the reforming of the entire education system . 
the committee recommended that the 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 system be changed to an 8 -- 4 -- 4 system -lrb- eight years in primary , four years in secondary , and four years in university education -rrb- . 
the table under present-day education in kenya below shows the structure of the 8 -- 4 -- 4 system . 
although the 7 -- 4 -- 2 -- 3 system theoretically ended with the introduction of the new 8 -- 4 -- 4 system in 1985 , the last batch of students from the former system graduated from kenyan universities in 1992 . 
the current 8 -- 4 -- 4 system was launched in january 1985 . 
it put more emphasis on vocational subjects on the assumption that the new structure would enable school drop-outs at all levels either to be self-employed or to secure employment in the informal sector .

in january 2003 , the government of kenya announced the introduction of free primary education . 
as a result , primary school enrolment increased by about 70 % . 
basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years comprising eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school . 
basic formal education starts at age six years and lasts 12 years comprising eight years in primary school and four years in high school or secondary school . 
primary school is free in public schools and those who exit at this level can join a vocational youth/village polytechnic or make their own arrangements for an apprenticeship program and learn a trade such as tailoring , carpentry , motor vehicle repair , brick-laying and masonry for about two years . 
those who complete high school can join a polytechnic or other technical college and study for three years or proceed directly to the university and study for four years . 
the country 's literacy level stands at 85 % of the whole population . 
preschool , which targets children from age three to five , is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to standard one -lrb- first grade -rrb- . 
preschool , which targets children from age three to five , is an integral component of the education system and is a key requirement for admission to standard one -lrb- first grade -rrb- . 
at the end of primary education , pupils sit the kenya certificate of primary education -lrb- kcpe -rrb- , which determines those who proceed to secondary school or vocational training . 
for those who proceed to secondary level , there is a national examination at the end of form four -- the kenya certificate of secondary education -lrb- kcse -rrb- , which determines those proceeding to the universities , other professional training or employment . 
other than the curriculum led learning , there are also national and public library services led by the kenya national library service -lrb- knls -rrb- . 
knls is the body mandated to establish , equip , manage and maintain national and public libraries in the country . 
a public library is seen as a peoples university since it is open to all irrespective of age , literacy level and has materials relevant to people of all walks of life .

new athletes gained attention , such as pamela jelimo , the women 's 800m gold medalist who went ahead to win the iaaf golden league jackpot , and samuel wanjiru who won the men 's marathon . 
lately , there has been controversy in kenyan athletics circles , with the defection of a number of kenyan athletes to represent other countries , chiefly bahrain and qatar . 
most of these defections occur because of economic or financial factors . 
kenya has been a dominant force in women 's volleyball within africa , with both the clubs and the national team winning various continental championships in the past decade . 
cricket is another popular and the most successful team sport . 
they upset some of the world 's best teams and reached semi-finals of the 2003 tournament . 
their current captain is rakep patel . 
however , its dominance has been eroded by wrangles within the now defunct kenya football federation , leading to a suspension by fifa which was lifted in march 2007 . 
in the motor rallying arena , kenya is home to the world famous safari rally , commonly acknowledged as one of the toughest rallies in the world .

kenyans generally have three meals in a day -- breakfast in the morning -lrb- kiamsha kinywa -rrb- , lunch in the afternoon -lrb- chakula cha mchana -rrb- and supper in the evening -lrb- chakula cha jioni or known simply as `` chajio '' -rrb- . 
in between , they have the 10 o'clock tea -lrb- chai ya saa nne -rrb- and 4 pm tea -lrb- chai ya saa kumi -rrb- . 
breakfast is usually tea or porridge with bread , chapati , mahamri , boiled sweet potatoes or yams . 
ugali with vegetables , sour milk , meat , fish or any other stew is generally eaten by much of the population for lunch or supper . 
the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- is a scientific intergovernmental body under the auspices of the united nations , set up at the request of member governments . 
it was first established in 1988 by two united nations organizations , the world meteorological organization -lrb- wmo -rrb- and the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- , and later endorsed by the united nations general assembly through resolution 43/53 . 
the ultimate objective of the unfccc is to `` stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic -lsb- i.e. , human-induced -rsb- interference with the climate system '' . 
the ipcc produces reports that support the united nations framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfccc -rrb- , which is the main international treaty on climate change .

both special reports were requested by governments . 
while the preparation of the assessment reports is a major ipcc function , it also supports other activities , such as the data distribution centre and the national greenhouse gas inventories programme , required under the unfccc . 
this involves publishing default emission factors , which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption , industrial production and so on .

over the six years studied , the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by ipcc 's 2001 projection , and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the ipcc projection . 
another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the ipcc , far from overstating dangers and risks , have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels . 
these values are much greater than the 9 -- 88 cm as projected by the ipcc itself in its third assessment report , published in 2001 '' . 
when the researchers ' analysis was `` applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5 -- 1.4 m -lsb- 50 -- 140 cm -rsb- above 1990 levels .

in case of the ozone depletion global regulation based on the montreal protocol has been successful , in case of climate change , the kyoto protocol failed . 
the lockstep situation of the ipcc is having built a broad science consensus while states and governments still follow different , if not opposing goals . 
according to sheldon ungar 's comparison with global warming , the actors in the ozone depletion case had a better understanding of scientific ignorance and uncertainties . 
in case of the ipcc conclusions and the failure of the kyoto protocol , varying regional cost-benefit analysis and burden-sharing conflicts with regard to the distribution of emission reductions remain an unsolved problem . 
the stepwise mitigation of the ozone layer challenge was based as well on successfully reducing regional burden sharing conflicts . 
in the uk , a report for a house of lords committee asked to urge the ipcc to involve better assessments of costs and benefits of climate change but the stern review ordered by the uk government made a stronger argument in favor to combat human-made climate change . 
since the ipcc does not carry out its own research , it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies , and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report 's final release . 
in principle , this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an ipcc report can not be included .

they then use the atp and nadph to make organic molecules from carbon dioxide in a process known as the calvin cycle . 
the number of chloroplasts per cell varies from 1 in algae up to 100 in plants like arabidopsis and wheat . 
chloroplasts are highly dynamic -- they circulate and are moved around within plant cells , and occasionally pinch in two to reproduce . 
their behavior is strongly influenced by environmental factors like light color and intensity . 
chloroplasts , like mitochondria , contain their own dna , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor -- a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell . 
chloroplasts , like mitochondria , contain their own dna , which is thought to be inherited from their ancestor -- a photosynthetic cyanobacterium that was engulfed by an early eukaryotic cell . 
chloroplasts can not be made by the plant cell and must be inherited by each daughter cell during cell division . 
chloroplasts are only found in plants and algae . 
this origin of chloroplasts was first suggested by the russian biologist konstantin mereschkowski in 1905 after andreas schimper observed in 1883 that chloroplasts closely resemble cyanobacteria .

cyanobacteria are considered the ancestors of chloroplasts . 
they are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes . 
they are a diverse phylum of bacteria capable of carrying out photosynthesis , and are gram-negative , meaning that they have two cell membranes . 
cyanobacteria also contain a peptidoglycan cell wall , which is thicker than in other gram-negative bacteria , and which is located between their two cell membranes . 
they are sometimes called blue-green algae even though they are prokaryotes . 
somewhere around a billion years ago , a free-living cyanobacterium entered an early eukaryotic cell , either as food or as an internal parasite , but managed to escape the phagocytic vacuole it was contained in .

the two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium 's gram negative cell wall , and not the phagosomal membrane from the host , which was probably lost . 
the two innermost lipid-bilayer membranes that surround all chloroplasts correspond to the outer and inner membranes of the ancestral cyanobacterium 's gram negative cell wall , and not the phagosomal membrane from the host , which was probably lost . 
over time , the cyanobacterium was assimilated , and many of its genes were lost or transferred to the nucleus of the host . 
these chloroplasts , which can be traced back directly to a cyanobacterial ancestor , are known as primary plastids -lrb- `` plastid '' in this context means almost the same thing as chloroplast -rrb- . 
all primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages -- the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage , the rhodophyte , or red algal chloroplast lineage , or the chloroplastidan , or green chloroplast lineage .

all primary chloroplasts belong to one of three chloroplast lineages -- the glaucophyte chloroplast lineage , the rhodophyte , or red algal chloroplast lineage , or the chloroplastidan , or green chloroplast lineage . 
the second two are the largest , and the green chloroplast lineage is the one that contains the land plants . 
the alga cyanophora , a glaucophyte , is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast . 
the alga cyanophora , a glaucophyte , is thought to be one of the first organisms to contain a chloroplast . 
for this reason , glaucophyte chloroplasts are also known as muroplasts . 
glaucophyte chloroplasts also contain concentric unstacked thylakoids , which surround a carboxysome - an icosahedral structure that glaucophyte chloroplasts and cyanobacteria keep their carbon fixation enzyme rubisco in .

rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments ; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color . 
rhodoplasts have a double membrane with an intermembrane space and phycobilin pigments organized into phycobilisomes on the thylakoid membranes , preventing their thylakoids from stacking . 
rhodoplasts have chlorophyll a and phycobilins for photosynthetic pigments ; the phycobilin phycoerytherin is responsible for giving many red algae their distinctive red color . 
the red phycoerytherin pigment is an adaptation to help red algae catch more sunlight in deep water -- as such , some red algae that live in shallow water have less phycoerytherin in their rhodoplasts , and can appear more greenish . 
rhodoplasts synthesize a form of starch called floridean , which collects into granules outside the rhodoplast , in the cytoplasm of the red alga . 
they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead . 
most green chloroplasts are -lrb- obviously -rrb- green , though some are n't , like some forms of hæmatococcus pluvialis , due to accessory pigments that override the chlorophylls ' green colors . 
chloroplastidan chloroplasts have lost the peptidoglycan wall between their double membrane , and have replaced it with an intermembrane space . 
some plants seem to have kept the genes for the synthesis of the peptidoglycan layer , though they 've been repurposed for use in chloroplast division instead . 
they differ from glaucophyte and red algal chloroplasts in that they have lost their phycobilisomes , and contain chlorophyll b instead . 
while primary chloroplasts have a double membrane from their cyanobacterial ancestor , secondary chloroplasts have additional membranes outside of the original two , as a result of the secondary endosymbiotic event , when a nonphotosynthetic eukaryote engulfed a chloroplast-containing alga but failed to digest it -- much like the cyanobacterium at the beginning of this story .

the engulfed alga was broken down , leaving only its chloroplast , and sometimes its cell membrane and nucleus , forming a chloroplast with three or four membranes -- the two cyanobacterial membranes , sometimes the eaten alga 's cell membrane , and the phagosomal vacuole from the host 's cell membrane .

euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga . 
euglenophytes are a group of common flagellated protists that contain chloroplasts derived from a green alga . 
euglenophyte chloroplasts have a pyrenoid and thylakoids stacked in groups of three . 
starch is stored in the form of paramylon , which is contained in membrane-bound granules in the cytoplasm of the euglenophyte . 
euglenophyte chloroplasts have three membranes -- it is thought that the membrane of the primary endosymbiont was lost , leaving the cyanobacterial membranes , and the secondary host 's phagosomal membrane . 
cryptophytes , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast . 
cryptophytes , or cryptomonads are a group of algae that contain a red-algal derived chloroplast . 
cryptophyte chloroplasts contain a nucleomorph that superficially resembles that of the chlorarachniophytes . 
they synthesize ordinary starch , which is stored in granules found in the periplastid space -- outside the original double membrane , in the place that corresponds to the red alga 's cytoplasm . 
inside cryptophyte chloroplasts is a pyrenoid and thylakoids in stacks of two . 
like the helicosproidia , they 're parasitic , and have a nonphotosynthetic chloroplast . 
apicomplexans are another group of chromalveolates . 
the apicomplexans include plasmodium , the malaria parasite . 
many apicomplexans keep a vestigial red algal derived chloroplast called an apicoplast , which they inherited from their ancestors . 
apicomplexans store their energy in amylopectin starch granules that are located in their cytoplasm , even though they are nonphotosynthetic . 
plant chloroplasts provide plant cells with many important things besides sugar , and apicoplasts are no different -- they synthesize fatty acids , isopentenyl pyrophosphate , iron-sulfur clusters , and carry out part of the heme pathway . 
this makes the apicoplast an attractive target for drugs to cure apicomplexan-related diseases . 
the most important apicoplast function is isopentenyl pyrophosphate synthesis -- in fact , apicomplexans die when something interferes with this apicoplast function , and when apicomplexans are grown in an isopentenyl pyrophosphate-rich medium , they dump the organelle . 
apicoplasts have lost all photosynthetic function , and contain no photosynthetic pigments or true thylakoids . 
they are bounded by four membranes , but the membranes are not connected to the endoplasmic reticulum . 
peridinin is not found in any other group of chloroplasts . 
the most common dinophyte chloroplast is the peridinin-type chloroplast , characterized by the carotenoid pigment peridinin in their chloroplasts , along with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c2 . 
they contain a pyrenoid , and have triplet-stacked thylakoids . 
the peridinin chloroplast is bounded by three membranes -lrb- occasionally two -rrb- , having lost the red algal endosymbiont 's original cell membrane . 
the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages -lrb- including karlodinium and karenia -rrb- lost their original red algal derived chloroplast , and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont . 
the fucoxanthin dinophyte lineages -lrb- including karlodinium and karenia -rrb- lost their original red algal derived chloroplast , and replaced it with a new chloroplast derived from a haptophyte endosymbiont . 
because the haptophyte chloroplast has four membranes , tertiary endosymbiosis would be expected to create a six membraned chloroplast , adding the haptophyte 's cell membrane and the dinophyte 's phagosomal vacuole .

members of the genus dinophysis have a phycobilin-containing chloroplast taken from a cryptophyte . 
however , the cryptophyte is not an endosymbiont -- only the chloroplast seems to have been taken , and the chloroplast has been stripped of its nucleomorph and outermost two membranes , leaving just a two-membraned chloroplast .

however the diatom endosymbiont ca n't store its own food -- its starch is found in granules in the dinophyte host 's cytoplasm instead . 
the chloroplast is surrounded by two membranes and has no nucleomorph -- all the nucleomorph genes have been transferred to the dinophyte nucleus . 
lepidodinium is the only dinophyte that has a chloroplast that 's not from the rhodoplast lineage . 
lepidodinium viride and its close relatives are dinophytes that lost their original peridinin chloroplast and replaced it with a green algal derived chloroplast -lrb- more specifically , a prasinophyte -rrb- .

chromatophore dna is about a million base pairs long , containing around 850 protein encoding genes -- far less than the three million base pair synechococcus genome , but much larger than the approximately 150,000 base pair genome of the more assimilated chloroplast .

chloroplasts have their own dna , often abbreviated as ctdna , or cpdna . 
it is also known as the plastome . 
its existence was first proved in 1962 , and first sequenced in 1986 -- when two japanese research teams sequenced the chloroplast dna of liverwort and tobacco .

the inverted repeat regions are highly conserved among land plants , and accumulate few mutations . 
similar inverted repeats exist in the genomes of cyanobacteria and the other two chloroplast lineages -lrb- glaucophyta and rhodophyceæ -rrb- , suggesting that they predate the chloroplast , though some chloroplast dnas have since lost or flipped the inverted repeats -lrb- making them direct repeats -rrb- . 
it is possible that the inverted repeats help stabilize the rest of the chloroplast genome , as chloroplast dnas which have lost some of the inverted repeat segments tend to get rearranged more . 
scientists have attempted to observe chloroplast replication via electron microscopy since the 1970s . 
the mechanism for chloroplast dna -lrb- cpdna -rrb- replication has not been conclusively determined , but two main models have been proposed . 
as the d-loop moves through the circular dna , it adopts a theta intermediary form , also known as a cairns replication intermediate , and completes replication with a rolling circle mechanism .

in cpdna , there are several a → g deamination gradients . 
dna becomes susceptible to deamination events when it is single stranded . 
this mechanism is still the leading theory today ; however , a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination . 
this mechanism is still the leading theory today ; however , a second theory suggests that most cpdna is actually linear and replicates through homologous recombination . 
it further contends that only a minority of the genetic material is kept in circular chromosomes while the rest is in branched , linear , or other complex structures . 
one of competing model for cpdna replication asserts that most cpdna is linear and participates in homologous recombination and replication structures similar to bacteriophage t4 . 
it has been established that some plants have linear cpdna , such as maize , and that more species still contain complex structures that scientists do not yet understand . 
because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have been shown to have circular cpdna , the predominant theory continues to hold that most cpdna is circular and most likely replicates via a d loop mechanism .

endosymbiotic gene transfer is how we know about the lost chloroplasts in many chromalveolate lineages . 
even if a chloroplast is eventually lost , the genes it donated to the former host 's nucleus persist , providing evidence for the lost chloroplast 's existence . 
for example , while diatoms -lrb- a heterokontophyte -rrb- now have a red algal derived chloroplast , the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor -lrb- probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too -rrb- had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point , which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast .

a few chloroplast genes found new homes in the mitochondrial genome -- most became nonfunctional pseudogenes , though a few trna genes still work in the mitochondrion . 
curiously , around half of the protein products of transferred genes are n't even targeted back to the chloroplast . 
many became exaptations , taking on new functions like participating in cell division , protein routing , and even disease resistance . 
some transferred chloroplast dna protein products get directed to the secretory pathway -lrb- though it should be noted that many secondary plastids are bounded by an outermost membrane derived from the host 's cell membrane , and therefore topologically outside of the cell , because to reach the chloroplast from the cytosol , you have to cross the cell membrane , just like if you were headed for the extracellular space . 
after a chloroplast polypeptide is synthesized on a ribosome in the cytosol , an enzyme specific to chloroplast proteins phosphorylates , or adds a phosphate group to many -lrb- but not all -rrb- of them in their transit sequences .

greater diversity in chloroplast shapes exists among the algae , which often contain a single chloroplast that can be shaped like a net -lrb- e.g. , oedogonium -rrb- , a cup -lrb- e.g. , chlamydomonas -rrb- , a ribbon-like spiral around the edges of the cell -lrb- e.g. , spirogyra -rrb- , or slightly twisted bands at the cell edges -lrb- e.g. , sirogonium -rrb- .

the fact that chloroplasts are surrounded by a double membrane is often cited as evidence that they are the descendants of endosymbiotic cyanobacteria . 
this is often interpreted as meaning the outer chloroplast membrane is the product of the host 's cell membrane infolding to form a vesicle to surround the ancestral cyanobacterium -- which is not true -- both chloroplast membranes are homologous to the cyanobacterium 's original double membranes .

the chloroplast double membrane is also often compared to the mitochondrial double membrane . 
this is not a valid comparison -- the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate atp energy . 
this is not a valid comparison -- the inner mitochondria membrane is used to run proton pumps and carry out oxidative phosphorylation across to generate atp energy . 
the only chloroplast structure that can considered analogous to it is the internal thylakoid system . 
in addition , in terms of function , the inner chloroplast membrane , which regulates metabolite passage and synthesizes some materials , has no counterpart in the mitochondrion . 
stromules are very rare in chloroplasts , and are much more common in other plastids like chromoplasts and amyloplasts in petals and roots , respectively . 
the chloroplast membranes sometimes protrude out into the cytoplasm , forming a stromule , or stroma-containing tubule . 
they may exist to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross-membrane transport , because they are often branched and tangled with the endoplasmic reticulum . 
when they were first observed in 1962 , some plant biologists dismissed the structures as artifactual , claiming that stromules were just oddly shaped chloroplasts with constricted regions or dividing chloroplasts . 
it is often found in the chloroplasts of c4 plants , though it has also been found in some c3 angiosperms , and even some gymnosperms . 
it is often found in the chloroplasts of c4 plants , though it has also been found in some c3 angiosperms , and even some gymnosperms . 
the chloroplast peripheral reticulum consists of a maze of membranous tubes and vesicles continuous with the inner chloroplast membrane that extends into the internal stromal fluid of the chloroplast . 
its purpose is thought to be to increase the chloroplast 's surface area for cross-membrane transport between its stroma and the cell cytoplasm . 
the small vesicles sometimes observed may serve as transport vesicles to shuttle stuff between the thylakoids and intermembrane space . 
chloroplasts have their own ribosomes , which they use to synthesize a small fraction of their proteins . 
chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes -lrb- around 17 nm vs 25 nm -rrb- . 
chloroplast ribosomes are about two-thirds the size of cytoplasmic ribosomes -lrb- around 17 nm vs 25 nm -rrb- .

plastoglobuli -lrb- singular plastoglobulus , sometimes spelled plastoglobule -lrb- s -rrb- -rrb- , are spherical bubbles of lipids and proteins about 45 -- 60 nanometers across . 
they are surrounded by a lipid monolayer . 
plastoglobuli were once thought to be free-floating in the stroma , but it is now thought that they are permanently attached either to a thylakoid or to another plastoglobulus attached to a thylakoid , a configuration that allows a plastoglobulus to exchange its contents with the thylakoid network .

in normal green chloroplasts , the vast majority of plastoglobuli occur singularly , attached directly to their parent thylakoid . 
in old or stressed chloroplasts , plastoglobuli tend to occur in linked groups or chains , still always anchored to a thylakoid . 
the chloroplasts of some hornworts and algae contain structures called pyrenoids . 
pyrenoids are roughly spherical and highly refractive bodies which are a site of starch accumulation in plants that contain them .

photosystem ii and photosystem i contain light-harvesting complexes with chlorophyll and carotenoids that absorb light energy and use it to energize electrons . 
molecules in the thylakoid membrane use the energized electrons to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , decreasing the ph and turning it acidic . 
atp synthase is a large protein complex that harnesses the concentration gradient of the hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space to generate atp energy as the hydrogen ions flow back out into the stroma -- much like a dam turbine . 
there are two types of thylakoids -- granal thylakoids , which are arranged in grana , and stromal thylakoids , which are in contact with the stroma .

to fix carbon dioxide into sugar molecules in the process of photosynthesis , chloroplasts use an enzyme called rubisco . 
rubisco has a problem -- it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen , so at high oxygen concentrations , rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors . 
rubisco has a problem -- it has trouble distinguishing between carbon dioxide and oxygen , so at high oxygen concentrations , rubisco starts accidentally adding oxygen to sugar precursors . 
this is a big problem , since o2 is produced by the initial light reactions of photosynthesis , causing issues down the line in the calvin cycle which uses rubisco . 
this has the end result of atp energy being wasted and co2 being released , all with no sugar being produced . 
in mesophyll cells , chloroplasts are specialized for the light reactions , so they lack rubisco , and have normal grana and thylakoids , which they use to make atp and nadph , as well as oxygen .

they store co2 in a four-carbon compound , which is why the process is called c4 photosynthesis . 
because the job of bundle sheath chloroplasts is to carry out the calvin cycle and make sugar , they often contain large starch grains .

in some plants such as cacti , chloroplasts are found in the stems , though in most plants , chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves . 
in some plants such as cacti , chloroplasts are found in the stems , though in most plants , chloroplasts are concentrated in the leaves . 
palisade mesophyll cells can contain 30 -- 70 chloroplasts per cell , while stomatal guard cells contain only around 8 -- 15 per cell , as well as much less chlorophyll . 
one square millimeter of leaf tissue can contain half a million chloroplasts . 
within a leaf , chloroplasts are mainly found in the mesophyll layers of a leaf , and the guard cells of stomata . 
in low-light conditions , they will spread out in a sheet -- maximizing the surface area to absorb light . 
under intense light , they will seek shelter by aligning in vertical columns along the plant cell 's cell wall or turning sideways so that light strikes them edge-on . 
this reduces exposure and protects them from photooxidative damage . 
this ability to distribute chloroplasts so that they can take shelter behind each other or spread out may be the reason why land plants evolved to have many small chloroplasts instead of a few big ones . 
mitochondria have also been observed to follow chloroplasts as they move . 
plants have two main immune responses -- the hypersensitive response , in which infected cells seal themselves off and undergo programmed cell death , and systemic acquired resistance , where infected cells release signals warning the rest of the plant of a pathogen 's presence .

chloroplasts stimulate both responses by purposely damaging their photosynthetic system , producing reactive oxygen species .

after detecting stress in a cell , which might be due to a pathogen , chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals . 
after detecting stress in a cell , which might be due to a pathogen , chloroplasts begin producing molecules like salicylic acid , jasmonic acid , nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species which can serve as defense-signals . 
as cellular signals , reactive oxygen species are unstable molecules , so they probably do n't leave the chloroplast , but instead pass on their signal to an unknown second messenger molecule . 
all these molecules initiate retrograde signaling -- signals from the chloroplast that regulate gene expression in the nucleus . 
one of the main functions of the chloroplast is its role in photosynthesis , the process by which light is transformed into chemical energy , to subsequently produce food in the form of sugars .

water -lrb- h2o -rrb- and carbon dioxide -lrb- co2 -rrb- are used in photosynthesis , and sugar and oxygen -lrb- o2 -rrb- is made , using light energy . 
like mitochondria , chloroplasts use the potential energy stored in an h + , or hydrogen ion gradient to generate atp energy . 
the molecules between the photosystems harness the electrons ' energy to pump hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space , creating a concentration gradient , with more hydrogen ions -lrb- up to a thousand times as many -rrb- inside the thylakoid system than in the stroma .

atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate , or atp . 
atp synthase uses the energy from the flowing hydrogen ions to phosphorylate adenosine diphosphate into adenosine triphosphate , or atp . 
normally , the reenergized electrons are taken by nadp + , though sometimes they can flow back down more h + - pumping electron transport chains to transport more hydrogen ions into the thylakoid space to generate more atp . 
this is termed cyclic photophosphorylation because the electrons are recycled . 
cyclic photophosphorylation is common in c4 plants , which need more atp than nadph .

the calvin cycle starts by using the enzyme rubisco to fix co2 into five-carbon ribulose bisphosphate -lrb- rubp -rrb- molecules . 
the result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid , or 3-pga . 
the result is unstable six-carbon molecules that immediately break down into three-carbon molecules called 3-phosphoglyceric acid , or 3-pga . 
most of the g3p molecules are recycled back into rubp using energy from more atp , but one out of every six produced leaves the cycle -- the end product of the dark reactions . 
alternatively , glucose monomers in the chloroplast can be linked together to make starch , which accumulates into the starch grains found in the chloroplast . 
under conditions such as high atmospheric co2 concentrations , these starch grains may grow very large , distorting the grana and thylakoids . 
under conditions such as high atmospheric co2 concentrations , these starch grains may grow very large , distorting the grana and thylakoids . 
waterlogged roots can also cause starch buildup in the chloroplasts , possibly due to less sucrose being exported out of the chloroplast -lrb- or more accurately , the plant cell -rrb- . 
while linked to low photosynthesis rates , the starch grains themselves may not necessarily interfere significantly with the efficiency of photosynthesis , and might simply be a side effect of another photosynthesis-depressing factor . 
rubisco can not distinguish between oxygen and carbon dioxide very well , so it can accidentally add o2 instead of co2 to rubp . 
photorespiration can occur when the oxygen concentration is too high . 
this process reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis -- it consumes atp and oxygen , releases co2 , and produces no sugar . 
it can waste up to half the carbon fixed by the calvin cycle . 
chloroplasts in c4 plants are notable as they exhibit a distinct chloroplast dimorphism . 
chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell 's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine . 
chloroplasts alone make almost all of a plant cell 's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like cysteine and methionine . 
cysteine is made in the chloroplast -lrb- the proplastid too -rrb- but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria , probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed . 
the chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if it happens in the cytosol . 
chloroplasts are a special type of a plant cell organelle called a plastid , though the two terms are sometimes used interchangeably . 
all chloroplasts in a plant are descended from undifferentiated proplastids found in the zygote , or fertilized egg . 
proplastids are commonly found in an adult plant 's apical meristems . 
chloroplasts do not normally develop from proplastids in root tip meristems -- instead , the formation of starch-storing amyloplasts is more common . 
if angiosperm shoots are not exposed to the required light for chloroplast formation , proplastids may develop into an etioplast stage before becoming chloroplasts . 
an etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll , and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma , called a prolamellar body . 
an etioplast is a plastid that lacks chlorophyll , and has inner membrane invaginations that form a lattice of tubes in their stroma , called a prolamellar body . 
while etioplasts lack chlorophyll , they have a yellow chlorophyll precursor stocked . 
gymnosperms do not require light to form chloroplasts . 
chloroplasts may be converted to chromoplasts , which are pigment-filled plastids responsible for the bright colors seen in flowers and ripe fruit .

if a plant is injured , or something else causes a plant cell to revert to a meristematic state , chloroplasts and other plastids can turn back into proplastids . 
the division process starts when the proteins ftsz1 and ftsz2 assemble into filaments , and with the help of a protein arc6 , form a structure called a z-ring within the chloroplast 's stroma .

in a few species like cyanidioschyzon merolæ , chloroplasts have a third plastid-dividing ring located in the chloroplast 's intermembrane space . 
light has been shown to be a requirement for chloroplast division . 
chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light , but are slow to complete division -- they require exposure to bright white light to complete division . 
spinach leaves grown under green light have been observed to contain many large dumbbell-shaped chloroplasts . 
chloroplasts can grow and progress through some of the constriction stages under poor quality green light , but are slow to complete division -- they require exposure to bright white light to complete division . 
since , in most flowering plants , chloroplasts are not inherited from the male parent , transgenes in these plastids can not be disseminated by pollen . 
this makes plastid transformation a valuable tool for the creation and cultivation of genetically modified plants that are biologically contained , thus posing significantly lower environmental risks . 
while the reliability of this mechanism has not yet been studied for all relevant crop species , recent results in tobacco plants are promising , showing a failed containment rate of transplastomic plants at 3 in 1,000,000 .

a prime number -lrb- or a prime -rrb- is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself . 
a natural number greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number . 
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . 
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic establishes the central role of primes in number theory : any integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes that is unique up to ordering . 
the uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization , e.g. , 3 , 1 · 3 , 1 · 1 · 3 , etc. are all valid factorizations of 3 . 
the property of being prime -lrb- or not -rrb- is called primality . 
a simple but slow method of verifying the primality of a given number n is known as trial division . 
these include the miller -- rabin primality test , which is fast but has a small probability of error , and the aks primality test , which always produces the correct answer in polynomial time but is too slow to be practical .

however , the distribution of primes , that is to say , the statistical behaviour of primes in the large , can be modelled . 
the first result in that direction is the prime number theorem , proven at the end of the 19th century , which says that the probability that a given , randomly chosen number n is prime is inversely proportional to its number of digits , or to the logarithm of n.

many questions regarding prime numbers remain open , such as goldbach 's conjecture -lrb- that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes -rrb- , and the twin prime conjecture -lrb- that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2 -rrb- .

such questions spurred the development of various branches of number theory , focusing on analytic or algebraic aspects of numbers . 
primes are used in several routines in information technology , such as public-key cryptography , which makes use of properties such as the difficulty of factoring large numbers into their prime factors . 
prime numbers give rise to various generalizations in other mathematical domains , mainly algebra , such as prime elements and prime ideals . 
no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n . 
no even number greater than 2 is prime because by definition , any such number n has at least three distinct divisors , namely 1 , 2 , and n . 
accordingly , the term odd prime refers to any prime number greater than 2 . 
similarly , when written in the usual decimal system , all prime numbers larger than 5 end in 1 , 3 , 7 , or 9 , since even numbers are multiples of 2 and numbers ending in 0 or 5 are multiples of 5 .

most early greeks did not even consider 1 to be a number , so they could not consider it to be a prime . 
in the mid-18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler -- who did not agree . 
in the mid-18th century christian goldbach listed 1 as the first prime in his famous correspondence with leonhard euler -- who did not agree . 
for example , derrick norman lehmer 's list of primes up to 10,006,721 , reprinted as late as 1956 , started with 1 as its first prime . 
by the early 20th century , mathematicians began to accept that 1 is not a prime number , but rather forms its own special category as a `` unit '' . 
a large body of mathematical work would still be valid when calling 1 a prime , but euclid 's fundamental theorem of arithmetic -lrb- mentioned above -rrb- would not hold as stated . 
similarly , the sieve of eratosthenes would not work correctly if 1 were considered a prime : a modified version of the sieve that considers 1 as prime would eliminate all multiples of 1 -lrb- that is , all other numbers -rrb- and produce as output only the single number 1 . 
furthermore , the prime numbers have several properties that the number 1 lacks , such as the relationship of the number to its corresponding value of euler 's totient function or the sum of divisors function .

there are hints in the surviving records of the ancient egyptians that they had some knowledge of prime numbers : the egyptian fraction expansions in the rhind papyrus , for instance , have quite different forms for primes and for composites . 
however , the earliest surviving records of the explicit study of prime numbers come from the ancient greeks . 
euclid 's elements -lrb- circa 300 bc -rrb- contain important theorems about primes , including the infinitude of primes and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . 
euclid also showed how to construct a perfect number from a mersenne prime . 
the sieve of eratosthenes , attributed to eratosthenes , is a simple method to compute primes , although the large primes found today with computers are not generated this way .

fermat also conjectured that all numbers of the form 22n + 1 are prime -lrb- they are called fermat numbers -rrb- and he verified this up to n = 4 -lrb- or 216 + 1 -rrb- .

the most basic method of checking the primality of a given integer n is called trial division . 
this routine can be implemented more efficiently if a complete list of primes up to is known -- then trial divisions need to be checked only for those m that are prime . 
this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n . 
for example , to check the primality of 37 , only three divisions are necessary -lrb- m = 2 , 3 , and 5 -rrb- , given that 4 and 6 are composite . 
this routine consists of dividing n by each integer m that is greater than 1 and less than or equal to the square root of n .

modern primality tests for general numbers n can be divided into two main classes , probabilistic -lrb- or `` monte carlo '' -rrb- and deterministic algorithms . 
for example , trial division is a deterministic algorithm because , if performed correctly , it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite . 
if we repeat the test n times and pass every time , then the probability that our number is composite is 1 / -lrb- 1-p -rrb- n , which decreases exponentially with the number of tests , so we can be as sure as we like -lrb- though never perfectly sure -rrb- that the number is prime . 
a particularly simple example of a probabilistic test is the fermat primality test , which relies on the fact -lrb- fermat 's little theorem -rrb- that np ≡ n -lrb- mod p -rrb- for any n if p is a prime number .

a flaw with this test is that there are some composite numbers -lrb- the carmichael numbers -rrb- that satisfy the fermat identity even though they are not prime , so the test has no way of distinguishing between prime numbers and carmichael numbers . 
more powerful extensions of the fermat primality test , such as the baillie-psw , miller-rabin , and solovay-strassen tests , are guaranteed to fail at least some of the time when applied to a composite number .

some of these primes have been found using distributed computing .

the electronic frontier foundation also offers $ 150,000 and $ 250,000 for primes with at least 100 million digits and 1 billion digits , respectively . 
some of the largest primes not known to have any particular form -lrb- that is , no simple formula such as that of mersenne primes -rrb- have been found by taking a piece of semi-random binary data , converting it to a number n , multiplying it by 256k for some positive integer k , and searching for possible primes within the interval -lsb- 256kn + 1 , 256k -lrb- n + 1 -rrb- − 1 -rsb- .

the latter formula can be shown using bertrand 's postulate -lrb- proven first by chebyshev -rrb- , which states that there always exists at least one prime number p with n < p < 2n − 2 , for any natural number n > 3 .

another formula is based on wilson 's theorem and generates the number 2 many times and all other primes exactly once . 
can have infinitely many primes only when a and q are coprime , i.e. , their greatest common divisor is one . 
if this necessary condition is satisfied , dirichlet 's theorem on arithmetic progressions asserts that the progression contains infinitely many primes . 
what is more , the primes are distributed equally among those rows in the long run -- the density of all primes congruent a modulo 9 is 1/6 . 
the rows -lrb- = progressions -rrb- starting with a = 3 , 6 , or 9 contain at most one prime number . 
in all other rows -lrb- a = 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 , and 8 -rrb- there are infinitely many prime numbers . 
the zeta function is closely related to prime numbers . 
for example , the aforementioned fact that there are infinitely many primes can also be seen using the zeta function : if there were only finitely many primes then ζ -lrb- 1 -rrb- would have a finite value . 
however , the harmonic series 1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... diverges -lrb- i.e. , exceeds any given number -rrb- , so there must be infinitely many primes .

one of them is goldbach 's conjecture , which asserts that every even integer n greater than 2 can be written as a sum of two primes . 
often having an elementary formulation , many of these conjectures have withstood a proof for decades : all four of landau 's problems from 1912 are still unsolved . 
as of february 2011 -lsb- update -rsb- , this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017 . 
weaker statements than this have been proven , for example vinogradov 's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes . 
chen 's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can be expressed as the sum of a prime and a semiprime , the product of two primes .

polignac 's conjecture is a strengthening of that conjecture , it states that for every positive integer n , there are infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes that differ by 2n . 
it is conjectured there are infinitely many primes of the form n2 + 1 . 
these conjectures are special cases of the broad schinzel 's hypothesis h. brocard 's conjecture says that there are always at least four primes between the squares of consecutive primes greater than 2 . 
for a long time , number theory in general , and the study of prime numbers in particular , was seen as the canonical example of pure mathematics , with no applications outside of the self-interest of studying the topic with the exception of use of prime numbered gear teeth to distribute wear evenly . 
in particular , number theorists such as british mathematician g. h. hardy prided themselves on doing work that had absolutely no military significance . 
however , this vision was shattered in the 1970s , when it was publicly announced that prime numbers could be used as the basis for the creation of public key cryptography algorithms .

they only pupate and then emerge from their burrows after 7 , 13 or 17 years , at which point they fly about , breed , and then die after a few weeks at most . 
the logic for this is believed to be that the prime number intervals between emergences make it very difficult for predators to evolve that could specialize as predators on magicicadas . 
over a 200-year period , average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14 - and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2 % higher than during outbreaks of 13 - and 17-year cicadas . 
generally , `` prime '' indicates minimality or indecomposability , in an appropriate sense . 
for example , the prime field is the smallest subfield of a field f containing both 0 and 1 . 
any knot can be uniquely expressed as a connected sum of prime knots . 
often a second , additional meaning is intended by using the word prime , namely that any object can be , essentially uniquely , decomposed into its prime components . 
for example , in knot theory , a prime knot is a knot that is indecomposable in the sense that it can not be written as the knot sum of two nontrivial knots . 
prime numbers give rise to two more general concepts that apply to elements of any commutative ring r , an algebraic structure where addition , subtraction and multiplication are defined : prime elements and irreducible elements .

an element p of r is called prime element if it is neither zero nor a unit -lrb- i.e. , does not have a multiplicative inverse -rrb- and satisfies the following requirement : given x and y in r such that p divides the product xy , then p divides x or y . 
an element is irreducible if it is not a unit and can not be written as a product of two ring elements that are not units . 
the fundamental theorem of arithmetic continues to hold in unique factorization domains . 
an example of such a domain is the gaussian integers z -lsb- i -rsb- , that is , the set of complex numbers of the form a + bi where i denotes the imaginary unit and a and b are arbitrary integers .

rational primes -lrb- i.e. prime elements in z -rrb- of the form 4k + 3 are gaussian primes , whereas rational primes of the form 4k + 1 are not . 
in ring theory , the notion of number is generally replaced with that of ideal . 
prime ideals , which generalize prime elements in the sense that the principal ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal , are an important tool and object of study in commutative algebra , algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry .

the prime ideals of the ring of integers are the ideals -lrb- 0 -rrb- , -lrb- 2 -rrb- , -lrb- 3 -rrb- , -lrb- 5 -rrb- , -lrb- 7 -rrb- , -lrb- 11 -rrb- , ... the fundamental theorem of arithmetic generalizes to the lasker -- noether theorem , which expresses every ideal in a noetherian commutative ring as an intersection of primary ideals , which are the appropriate generalizations of prime powers .

prime ideals are the points of algebro-geometric objects , via the notion of the spectrum of a ring . 
for example , factorization or ramification of prime ideals when lifted to an extension field , a basic problem of algebraic number theory , bears some resemblance with ramification in geometry . 
for example , prime ideals in the ring of integers of quadratic number fields can be used in proving quadratic reciprocity , a statement that concerns the solvability of quadratic equations

in particular , this norm gets smaller when a number is multiplied by p , in sharp contrast to the usual absolute value -lrb- also referred to as the infinite prime -rrb- . 
certain arithmetic questions related to q or more general global fields may be transferred back and forth to the completed -lrb- or local -rrb- fields . 
while completing q -lrb- roughly , filling the gaps -rrb- with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers , completing with respect to the p-adic norm | − | p yields the field of p-adic numbers . 
this local-global principle again underlines the importance of primes to number theory . 
the french composer olivier messiaen used prime numbers to create ametrical music through `` natural phenomena '' . 
in works such as la nativité du seigneur -lrb- 1935 -rrb- and quatre études de rythme -lrb- 1949 -- 50 -rrb- , he simultaneously employs motifs with lengths given by different prime numbers to create unpredictable rhythms : the primes 41 , 43 , 47 and 53 appear in the third étude , `` neumes rythmiques '' .

according to messiaen this way of composing was `` inspired by the movements of nature , movements of free and unequal durations '' .

the dominant economic sectors in the middle rhine area are viniculture and tourism . 
the rhine gorge between rüdesheim am rhein and koblenz is listed as a unesco world heritage site . 
near sankt goarshausen , the rhine flows around the famous rock lorelei . 
with its outstanding architectural monuments , the slopes full of vines , settlements crowded on the narrow river banks and scores of castles lined up along the top of the steep slopes , the middle rhine valley can be considered the epitome of the rhine romanticism .

the rhine-meuse delta , the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn , close to the dutch-german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn . 
the rhine-meuse delta , the most important natural region of the netherlands begins near millingen aan de rijn , close to the dutch-german border with the division of the rhine into waal and nederrijn . 
since the rhine contributes most of the water , the shorter term rhine delta is commonly used . 
the shape of the rhine delta is determined by two bifurcations : first , at millingen aan de rijn , the rhine splits into waal and pannerdens kanaal , which changes its name to nederrijn at angeren , and second near arnhem , the ijssel branches off from the nederrijn . 
this creates three main flows , two of which change names rather often . 
the largest and southern main branch begins as waal and continues as boven merwede -lrb- `` upper merwede '' -rrb- , beneden merwede -lrb- `` lower merwede '' -rrb- , noord river -lrb- `` north river '' -rrb- , nieuwe maas -lrb- `` new meuse '' -rrb- , het scheur -lrb- `` the rip '' -rrb- and nieuwe waterweg -lrb- `` new waterway '' -rrb- . 
three more flows carry significant amounts of water : the nieuwe merwede -lrb- `` new merwede '' -rrb- , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from boven to beneden merwede ; the oude maas -lrb- `` old meuse '' -rrb- , which branches off from the southern branch where it changes from beneden merwede into noord , and dordtse kil , which branches off from oude maas .

the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents . 
the rhine-meuse delta is a tidal delta , shaped not only by the sedimentation of the rivers , but also by tidal currents . 
this meant that high tide formed a serious risk because strong tidal currents could tear huge areas of land into the sea . 
at the waal , for example , the most landward tidal influence can be detected between brakel and zaltbommel . 
the present mediterranean sea descends from this somewhat larger tethys sea . 
at about 180 mbp , in the jurassic period , the two plates reversed direction and began to compress the tethys floor , causing it to be subducted under eurasia and pushing up the edge of the latter plate in the alpine orogeny of the oligocene and miocene periods . 
several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography : iberia pushed up the pyrenees ; italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands . 
in southern europe , the stage was set in the triassic period of the mesozoic era , with the opening of the tethys ocean , between the eurasian and african tectonic plates , between about 240 mbp and 220 mbp -lrb- million years before present -rrb- . 
several microplates were caught in the squeeze and rotated or were pushed laterally , generating the individual features of mediterranean geography : iberia pushed up the pyrenees ; italy , the alps , and anatolia , moving west , the mountains of greece and the islands . 
from the eocene onwards , the ongoing alpine orogeny caused a n -- s rift system to develop in this zone . 
the main elements of this rift are the upper rhine graben , in southwest germany and eastern france and the lower rhine embayment , in northwest germany and the southeastern netherlands . 
by the time of the miocene , a river system had developed in the upper rhine graben , that continued northward and is considered the first rhine river . 
at that time , it did not yet carry discharge from the alps ; instead , the watersheds of the rhone and danube drained the northern flanks of the alps . 
through stream capture , the rhine extended its watershed southward . 
by the pliocene period , the rhine had captured streams down to the vosges mountains , including the mosel , the main and the neckar .

around 2.5 million years ago -lrb- ending 11,600 years ago -rrb- was the geological period of the ice ages . 
since approximately 600,000 years ago , six major ice ages have occurred , in which sea level dropped 120 m -lrb- 390 ft -rrb- and much of the continental margins became exposed .

in the early pleistocene , the rhine followed a course to the northwest , through the present north sea . 
since then , during glacial times , the river mouth was located offshore of brest , france and rivers , like the thames and the seine , became tributaries to the rhine . 
the last glacial ran from ~ 74,000 -lrb- bp = before present -rrb- , until the end of the pleistocene -lrb- ~ 11,600 bp -rrb- . 
the last glacial ran from ~ 74,000 -lrb- bp = before present -rrb- , until the end of the pleistocene -lrb- ~ 11,600 bp -rrb- . 
during this time , the lower rhine flowed roughly west through the netherlands and extended to the southwest , through the english channel and finally , to the atlantic ocean . 
the english channel , the irish channel and most of the north sea were dry land , mainly because sea level was approximately 120 m -lrb- 390 ft -rrb- lower than today .

most of the rhine 's current course was not under the ice during the last ice age ; although , its source must still have been a glacier . 
a tundra , with ice age flora and fauna , stretched across middle europe , from asia to the atlantic ocean . 
such was the case during the last glacial maximum , ca. 22,000 -- 14,000 yr bp , when ice-sheets covered scandinavia , the baltics , scotland and the alps , but left the space between as open tundra .

the loess or wind-blown dust over that tundra , settled in and around the rhine valley , contributing to its current agricultural usefulness . 
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring . 
as northwest europe slowly began to warm up from 22,000 years ago onward , frozen subsoil and expanded alpine glaciers began to thaw and fall-winter snow covers melted in spring . 
much of the discharge was routed to the rhine and its downstream extension . 
rapid warming and changes of vegetation , to open forest , began about 13,000 bp . 
by 9000 bp , europe was fully forested . 
since 7500 yr ago , a situation with tides and currents , very similar to present has existed . 
rates of sea-level rise had dropped so far , that natural sedimentation by the rhine and coastal processes together , could compensate the transgression by the sea ; in the last 7000 years , the coast line was roughly at the same location .

in the southern north sea , due to ongoing tectonic subsidence , the sea level is still rising , at the rate of about 1 -- 3 cm -lrb- 0.39 -- 1.18 in -rrb- per century -lrb- 1 metre or 39 inches in last 3000 years -rrb- .

since ~ 3000 yr bp -lrb- = years before present -rrb- , human impact is seen in the delta . 
this caused increased flooding and sedimentation , ending peat formation in the delta . 
as a result of increasing land clearance -lrb- bronze age agriculture -rrb- , in the upland areas -lrb- central germany -rrb- , the sediment load of the rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up . 
this was followed by embankment , of the major distributaries and damming of minor distributaries , which took place in the 11 -- 13th century ad . 
over the past 6000 years , approximately 80 avulsions have occurred .

the discharge of the rhine is divided among three branches : the river waal -lrb- 6/9 of total discharge -rrb- , the river nederrijn -- lek -lrb- 2/9 of total discharge -rrb- and the river ijssel -lrb- 1/9 of total discharge -rrb- . 
the rhine was not known to herodotus and first enters the historical period in the 1st century bc in roman-era geography . 
at that time , it formed the boundary between gaul and germania . 
the upper rhine had been part of the areal of the late hallstatt culture since the 6th century bc , and by the 1st century bc , the areal of the la tène culture covered almost its entire length , forming a contact zone with the jastorf culture , i.e. the locus of early celtic-germanic cultural contact . 
in roman geography , the rhine formed the boundary between gallia and germania by definition ; e.g. maurus servius honoratus , commentary on the aeneid of vergil -lrb- 8.727 -rrb- -lrb- rhenus -rrb- fluvius galliae , qui germanos a gallia dividit '' -lrb- the rhine is a -rrb- river of gaul , which divides the germanic people from gaul .

from the death of augustus in ad 14 until after ad 70 , rome accepted as her germanic frontier the water-boundary of the rhine and upper danube . 
the northern section of this frontier , where the rhine is deep and broad , remained the roman boundary until the empire fell . 
the germanic populations of these lands seem in roman times to have been scanty , and roman subjects from the modern alsace-lorraine had drifted across the river eastwards . 
the southern part was different . 
the romans kept eight legions in five bases along the rhine . 
between about ad 14 and 180 , the assignment of legions was as follows : for the army of germania inferior , two legions at vetera -lrb- xanten -rrb- , i germanica and xx valeria -lrb- pannonian troops -rrb- ; two legions at oppidum ubiorum -lrb- `` town of the ubii '' -rrb- , which was renamed to colonia agrippina , descending to cologne , v alaudae , a celtic legion recruited from gallia narbonensis and xxi , possibly a galatian legion from the other side of the empire .

by the 6th century , the rhine was within the borders of francia .

since the peace of westphalia , the upper rhine formed a contentious border between france and germany . 
establishing `` natural borders '' on the rhine was a long-term goal of french foreign policy , since the middle ages , though the language border was -- and is -- far more to the west . 
the confederation of the rhine was established by napoleon , as a french client state , in 1806 and lasted until 1814 , during which time it served as a significant source of resources and military manpower for the first french empire .

in 1840 , the rhine crisis , prompted by french prime minister adolphe thiers 's desire to reinstate the rhine as a natural border , led to a diplomatic crisis and a wave of nationalism in germany . 
at the end of world war i , the rhineland was subject to the treaty of versailles . 
this decreed that it would be occupied by the allies , until 1935 and after that , it would be a demilitarised zone , with the german army forbidden to enter .

the treaty of versailles and this particular provision , in general , caused much resentment in germany and is often cited as helping adolf hitler 's rise to power . 
the allies left the rhineland , in 1930 and the german army re-occupied it in 1936 , which was enormously popular in germany . 
the rhine bridge at arnhem , immortalized in the book , a bridge too far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for arnhem , during the failed operation market garden of september 1944 . 
in world war ii , it was recognised that the rhine would present a formidable natural obstacle to the invasion of germany , by the western allies . 
the rhine bridge at arnhem , immortalized in the book , a bridge too far and the film , was a central focus of the battle for arnhem , during the failed operation market garden of september 1944 . 
in a separate operation , the ludendorff bridge , crossing the rhine at remagen , became famous , when u.s. forces were able to capture it intact -- much to their own surprise -- after the germans failed to demolish it . 
seven days to the river rhine was a warsaw pact war plan for an invasion of western europe during the cold war . 
until 1932 the generally accepted length of the rhine was 1,230 kilometres -lrb- 764 miles -rrb- . 
in 1932 the german encyclopedia knaurs lexikon stated the length as 1,320 kilometres -lrb- 820 miles -rrb- , presumably a typographical error .

suggestions for a ` devolved ' parliament were made before 1914 , but were shelved due to the outbreak of the first world war . 
a sharp rise in nationalism in scotland during the late 1960s fuelled demands for some form of home rule or complete independence , and in 1969 prompted the incumbent labour government of harold wilson to set up the kilbrandon commission to consider the british constitution . 
kilbrandon published his report in 1973 recommending the establishment of a directly elected scottish assembly to legislate for the majority of domestic scottish affairs . 
during this time , the discovery of oil in the north sea and the following `` it 's scotland 's oil '' campaign of the scottish national party -lrb- snp -rrb- resulted in rising support for scottish independence , as well as the snp .

the combined effect of these events led to prime minister wilson committing his government to some form of devolved legislature in 1974 . 
the party argued that the revenues from the oil were not benefitting scotland as much as they should . 
however , it was not until 1978 that final legislative proposals for a scottish assembly were passed by the united kingdom parliament . 
under the terms of the scotland act 1978 , an elected assembly would be set up in edinburgh provided that the majority of the scottish electorate voted for it in a referendum to be held on 1 march 1979 that represented at least 40 % of the total electorate .

in the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat , the campaign for a scottish assembly was initiated as a pressure group , leading to the 1989 scottish constitutional convention with various organisations such as scottish churches , political parties and representatives of industry taking part . 
publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995 , the convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the parliament . 
since september 2004 , the official home of the scottish parliament has been a new scottish parliament building , in the holyrood area of edinburgh . 
the scottish parliament building was designed by spanish architect enric miralles in partnership with local edinburgh architecture firm rmjm which was led by design principal tony kettle .

some of the principal features of the complex include leaf-shaped buildings , a grass-roofed branch merging into adjacent parkland and gabion walls formed from the stones of previous buildings . 
queen elizabeth ii opened the new building on 9 october 2004 . 
this building was vacated twice to allow for the meeting of the church 's general assembly . 
whilst the permanent building at holyrood was being constructed , the parliament 's temporary home was the general assembly hall of the church of scotland on the royal mile in edinburgh . 
official photographs and television interviews were held in the courtyard adjoining the assembly hall , which is part of the school of divinity of the university of edinburgh . 
in may 2000 , the parliament was temporarily relocated to the former strathclyde regional council debating chamber in glasgow , and to the university of aberdeen in may 2002 .

in addition to the general assembly hall , the parliament also used buildings rented from the city of edinburgh council . 
the former administrative building of lothian regional council on george iv bridge was used for the msp 's offices . 
following the move to holyrood in 2004 this building was demolished . 
the former midlothian county buildings facing parliament square , high street and george iv bridge in edinburgh -lrb- originally built as the headquarters of the pre-1975 midlothian county council -rrb- housed the parliament 's visitors ' centre and shop , whilst the main hall was used as the parliament 's principal committee room .

after each election to the scottish parliament , at the beginning of each parliamentary session , parliament elects one msp to serve as presiding officer , the equivalent of the speaker -lrb- currently tricia marwick -rrb- , and two msps to serve as deputies -lrb- currently elaine smith and john scott -rrb- .

a vote clerk sits in front of the presiding officer and operates the electronic voting equipment and chamber clocks . 
as a member of the scottish parliamentary corporate body , the presiding officer is responsible for ensuring that the parliament functions effectively and has the staff , property and resources it requires to operate . 
convening the parliamentary bureau , which allocates time and sets the work agenda in the chamber , is another of the roles of the presiding officer . 
under the standing orders of the parliament the bureau consists of the presiding officer and one representative from each political parties with five or more seats in the parliament . 
the presiding officer also represents the scottish parliament at home and abroad in an official capacity . 
the debating chamber of the scottish parliament has seating arranged in a hemicycle , which reflects the desire to encourage consensus amongst elected members .

there are 131 seats in the debating chamber . 
of the total 131 seats , 129 are occupied by the parliament 's elected msps and 2 are seats for the scottish law officers -- the lord advocate and the solicitor general for scotland , who are not elected members of the parliament but are members of the scottish government . 
as such the law officers may attend and speak in the plenary meetings of the parliament but , as they are not elected msps , can not vote . 
in front of the presiding officers ' desk is the parliamentary mace , which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from scottish rivers and inscribed with the words : wisdom , compassion , justice and integrity .

parliament typically sits tuesdays , wednesdays and thursdays from early january to late june and from early september to mid december , with two-week recesses in april and october . 
plenary meetings in the debating chamber usually take place on wednesday afternoons from 2 pm to 6 pm and on thursdays from 9:15 am to 6 pm . 
chamber debates and committee meetings are open to the public . 
entry is free , but booking in advance is recommended due to limited space . 
proceedings are also recorded in text form , in print and online , in the official report , which is the substantially verbatim transcript of parliamentary debates . 
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith . 
the first item of business on wednesdays is usually time for reflection , at which a speaker addresses members for up to four minutes , sharing a perspective on issues of faith . 
invitations to address parliament in this manner are determined by the presiding officer on the advice of the parliamentary bureau . 
speakers are drawn from across scotland and are chosen to represent the balance of religious beliefs according to the scottish census . 
faith groups can make direct representations to the presiding officer to nominate speakers . 
the presiding officer -lrb- or deputy presiding officer -rrb- decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak . 
the presiding officer -lrb- or deputy presiding officer -rrb- decides who speaks in chamber debates and the amount of time for which they are allowed to speak . 
normally , the presiding officer tries to achieve a balance between different viewpoints and political parties when selecting members to speak . 
typically , ministers or party leaders open debates , with opening speakers given between 5 and 20 minutes , and succeeding speakers allocated less time . 
the scottish parliament has conducted debates in the gaelic language . 
each sitting day , normally at 5 pm , msps decide on all the motions and amendments that have been moved that day . 
this `` decision time '' is heralded by the sounding of the division bell , which is heard throughout the parliamentary campus and alerts msps who are not in the chamber to return and vote .

if there is audible dissent , the presiding officer announces `` there will be a division '' and members vote by means of electronic consoles on their desks . 
as a result , the outcome of each division is known in seconds . 
the outcome of most votes can be predicted beforehand since political parties normally instruct members which way to vote .

parties entrust some msps , known as whips , with the task of ensuring that party members vote according to the party line . 
this is typically done on moral issues . 
errant members can be deselected as official party candidates during future elections , and , in serious cases , may be expelled from their parties outright . 
immediately after decision time a `` members debate '' is held , which lasts for 45 minutes . 
members business is a debate on a motion proposed by an msp who is not a scottish minister .

as well as the proposer , other members normally contribute to the debate . 
the relevant minister , whose department the debate and motion relate to `` winds up '' the debate by speaking after all other participants . 
much of the work of the scottish parliament is done in committee . 
the role of committees is stronger in the scottish parliament than in other parliamentary systems , partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber .

the principal role of committees in the scottish parliament is to take evidence from witnesses , conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation . 
committees can also meet at other locations throughout scotland . 
committees comprise a small number of msps , with membership reflecting the balance of parties across parliament .

there are different committees with their functions set out in different ways . 
mandatory committees are committees which are set down under the scottish parliament 's standing orders , which govern their remits and proceedings . 
the current mandatory committees in the fourth session of the scottish parliament are : public audit ; equal opportunities ; european and external relations ; finance ; public petitions ; standards , procedures and public appointments ; and delegated powers and law reform . 
subject committees are established at the beginning of each parliamentary session , and again the members on each committee reflect the balance of parties across parliament . 
typically each committee corresponds with one -lrb- or more -rrb- of the departments -lrb- or ministries -rrb- of the scottish government . 
the current subject committees in the fourth session are : economy , energy and tourism ; education and culture ; health and sport ; justice ; local government and regeneration ; rural affairs , climate change and environment ; welfare reform ; and infrastructure and capital investment .

a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government . 
private bills normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property . 
a further type of committee is normally set up to scrutinise private bills submitted to the scottish parliament by an outside party or promoter who is not a member of the scottish parliament or scottish government . 
private bill committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the edinburgh tram network , the glasgow airport rail link , the airdrie-bathgate rail link and extensions to the national gallery of scotland . 
the scotland act 1998 , which was passed by the parliament of the united kingdom and given royal assent by queen elizabeth ii on 19 november 1998 , governs the functions and role of the scottish parliament and delimits its legislative competence .

the scotland act 2012 extends the devolved competencies . 
for the purposes of parliamentary sovereignty , the parliament of the united kingdom at westminster continues to constitute the supreme legislature of scotland . 
the scottish parliament has the power to pass laws and has limited tax-varying capability . 
the specific devolved matters are all subjects which are not explicitly stated in schedule 5 to the scotland act as reserved matters . 
all matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the scottish parliament . 
all matters that are not specifically reserved are automatically devolved to the scottish parliament . 
the scottish parliament has the ability to alter income tax in scotland by up to 3 pence in the pound . 
the 2012 act conferred further fiscal devolution including borrowing powers and some other unconnected matters such as setting speed limits and control of air guns . 
reserved matters are subjects that are outside the legislative competence of the scotland parliament .

bills can be introduced to parliament in a number of ways ; the scottish government can introduce new laws or amendments to existing laws as a bill ; a committee of the parliament can present a bill in one of the areas under its remit ; a member of the scottish parliament can introduce a bill as a private member ; or a private bill can be submitted to parliament by an outside proposer .

bills pass through parliament in a number of stages : 
stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to parliament together with its accompanying documents -- explanatory notes , a policy memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a financial memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it . 
stage 1 is the first , or introductory stage of the bill , where the minister or member in charge of the bill will formally introduce it to parliament together with its accompanying documents -- explanatory notes , a policy memorandum setting out the policy underlying the bill , and a financial memorandum setting out the costs and savings associated with it . 
statements from the presiding officer and the member in charge of the bill are also lodged indicating whether the bill is within the legislative competence of the parliament . 
stage 1 usually takes place , initially , in the relevant committee or committees and is then submitted to the whole parliament for a full debate in the chamber on the general principles of the bill . 
if the whole parliament agrees in a vote to the general principles of the bill , it then proceeds to stage 2 . 
stage 3 is the final stage of the bill and is considered at a meeting of the whole parliament . 
this stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill . 
this stage comprises two parts : consideration of amendments to the bill as a general debate , and a final vote on the bill . 
opposition members can table `` wrecking amendments '' to the bill , designed to thwart further progress and take up parliamentary time , to cause the bill to fall without a final vote being taken . 
after a general debate on the final form of the bill , members proceed to vote at decision time on whether they agree to the general principles of the final bill . 
royal assent : after the bill has been passed , the presiding officer submits it to the monarch for royal assent and it becomes an act of the scottish parliament .

instead they begin with a phrase that reads : `` the bill for this act of the scottish parliament was passed by the parliament on -lsb- date -rsb- and received royal assent on -lsb- date -rsb- '' . 
the party , or parties , that hold the majority of seats in the parliament forms the scottish government . 
any member can put their name forward to be first minister , and a vote is taken by all members of parliament . 
in contrast to many other parliamentary systems , parliament elects a first minister from a number of candidates at the beginning of each parliamentary term -lrb- after a general election -rrb- . 
most ministers and their juniors are drawn from amongst the elected msps , with the exception of scotland 's chief law officers : the lord advocate and the solicitor general . 
whilst the first minister chooses the ministers -- and may decide to remove them at any time -- the formal appointment or dismissal is made by the sovereign . 
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years -lrb- 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on -rrb- . 
under the scotland act 1998 , ordinary general elections for the scottish parliament are held on the first thursday in may every four years -lrb- 1999 , 2003 , 2007 and so on -rrb- . 
the date of the poll may be varied by up to one month either way by the monarch on the proposal of the presiding officer . 
extraordinary general elections are in addition to ordinary general elections , unless held less than six months before the due date of an ordinary general election , in which case they supplant it . 
if the parliament itself resolves that it should be dissolved -lrb- with at least two-thirds of the members voting in favour -rrb- , or if the parliament fails to nominate one of its members to be first minister within 28 days of a general election or of the position becoming vacant , the presiding officer proposes a date for an extraordinary general election and the parliament is dissolved by the queen by royal proclamation . 
several procedures enable the scottish parliament to scrutinise the government . 
the first minister or members of the cabinet can deliver statements to parliament upon which msps are invited to question . 
for example , at the beginning of each parliamentary year , the first minister delivers a statement to the chamber setting out the government 's legislative programme for the forthcoming year . 
after the statement has been delivered , the leaders of the opposition parties and other msps question the first minister on issues related to the substance of the statement . 
parliamentary time is also set aside for question periods in the debating chamber . 
a `` general question time '' takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government . 
a `` general question time '' takes place on a thursday between 11:40 a.m. and 12 p.m. where members can direct questions to any member of the scottish government . 
this gives members an opportunity to question the first minister directly on issues under their jurisdiction . 
the four general questions available to opposition leaders are : 
of the 129 msps , 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies and are known as `` constituency msps '' . 
the 73 scottish parliament constituencies shared the same boundaries as the uk parliament constituencies in scotland , prior to the 2005 reduction in the number of scottish mps , with the exception of orkney and shetland which each return their own constituency msp . 
voters choose one member to represent the constituency , and the member with most votes is returned as a constituency msp . 
the island archipelagos of orkney , shetland and the western isles comprise a much smaller number of electors , due to their dispersed population and distance from the scottish parliament in edinburgh . 
currently , the average scottish parliament constituency comprises 55,000 electors . 
the total number of seats in the parliament are allocated to parties proportionally to the number of votes received in the second vote of the ballot using the d'hondt method .

the party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat . 
the party with the highest quotient is awarded the seat , which is then added to its constituency seats in allocating the second seat . 
this is repeated iteratively until all available list seats are allocated . 
as in the house of commons , a number of qualifications apply to being an msp . 
such qualifications were introduced under the house of commons disqualification act 1975 and the british nationality act 1981 . 
specifically , members must be over the age of 18 and must be a citizen of the united kingdom , the republic of ireland , one of the countries in the commonwealth of nations , a citizen of a british overseas territory , or a european union citizen resident in the uk . 
members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the scottish parliament as elected msps , and similarly , civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified . 
an individual may not sit in the scottish parliament if he or she is judged to be insane under the terms of the mental health -lrb- care and treatment -rrb- -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 2003 . 
the election produced a majority snp government , making this the first time in the scottish parliament where a party has commanded a parliamentary majority . 
the snp took 16 seats from labour , with many of their key figures not returned to parliament , although labour leader iain gray retained east lothian by 151 votes .

the snp took a further eight seats from the liberal democrats and one seat from the conservatives . 
the snp overall majority meant that there was sufficient support in the scottish parliament to hold a referendum on scottish independence . 
for the conservatives , the main disappointment was the loss of edinburgh pentlands , the seat of former party leader david mcletchie , to the snp .

a procedural consequence of the establishment of the scottish parliament is that scottish mps sitting in the uk house of commons are able to vote on domestic legislation that applies only to england , wales and northern ireland -- whilst english , scottish , welsh and northern irish westminster mps are unable to vote on the domestic legislation of the scottish parliament .

this phenomenon is known as the west lothian question and has led to criticism . 
following the conservative victory in the 2015 uk election , standing orders of the house of commons were changed to give mps representing english constituencies a new `` veto '' over laws only affecting england .

islamism favors the reordering of government and society in accordance with the shari'a . 
the different islamist movements have been described as `` oscillating between two poles '' : at one end is a strategy of islamization of society through state power seized by revolution or invasion ; at the other `` reformist '' pole islamists work to islamize society gradually `` from the bottom up '' .

moderate and reformist islamists who accept and work within the democratic process include parties like the tunisian ennahda movement .

another major division within islamism is between what graham e. fuller has described as the fundamentalist `` guardians of the tradition '' -lrb- salafis , such as those in the wahhabi movement -rrb- and the `` vanguard of change and islamic reform '' centered around the muslim brotherhood . 
olivier roy argues that `` sunni pan-islamism underwent a remarkable shift in the second half of the 20th century '' when the muslim brotherhood movement and its focus on islamisation of pan-arabism was eclipsed by the salafi movement with its emphasis on `` sharia rather than the building of islamic institutions , '' and rejection of shia islam .

following the arab spring , roy has described islamism as `` increasingly interdependent '' with democracy in much of the arab muslim world , such that `` neither can now survive without the other . '' 
while islamist political culture itself may not be democratic , islamists need democratic elections to maintain their legitimacy . 
islamism is a controversial concept not just because it posits a political role for islam but also because its supporters believe their views merely reflect islam , while the contrary idea that islam is , or can be , apolitical is an error .

islamists have asked the question , `` if islam is a way of life , how can we say that those who want to live by its principles in legal , social , political , economic , and political spheres of life are not muslims , but islamists and believe in islamism , not -lsb- just -rsb- islam ? '' 
similarly , a writer for the international crisis group maintains that `` the conception of ` political islam ' '' is a creation of americans to explain the iranian islamic revolution and apolitical islam was a historical fluke of the `` short-lived era of the heyday of secular arab nationalism between 1945 and 1970 '' , and it is quietist/non-political islam , not islamism , that requires explanation .

this `` gentlemen 's agreement '' between sadat and islamists broke down in 1975 but not before islamists came to completely dominate university student unions . 
sadat was later assassinated and a formidable insurgency was formed in egypt in the 1990s . 
the interpretation of islam promoted by this funding was the strict , conservative saudi-based wahhabism or salafism . 
in its harshest form it preached that muslims should not only `` always oppose '' infidels `` in every way , '' but `` hate them for their religion ... for allah 's sake , '' that democracy `` is responsible for all the horrible wars of the 20th century , '' that shia and other non-wahhabi muslims were infidels , etc. .

while this effort has by no means converted all , or even most muslims to the wahhabist interpretation of islam , it has done much to overwhelm more moderate local interpretations , and has set the saudi-interpretation of islam as the `` gold standard '' of religion in minds of some or many muslims . 
islamist movements such as the muslim brotherhood , `` are well known for providing shelters , educational assistance , free or low cost medical clinics , housing assistance to students from out of town , student advisory groups , facilitation of inexpensive mass marriage ceremonies to avoid prohibitively costly dowry demands , legal assistance , sports facilities , and women 's groups . '' 
all this compares very favourably against incompetent , inefficient , or neglectful governments whose commitment to social justice is limited to rhetoric .

while studying law and philosophy in england and germany , iqbal became a member of the london branch of the all india muslim league . 
he was a critic of the mainstream indian nationalist and secularist indian national congress . 
he came back to lahore in 1908 . 
iqbal 's seven english lectures were published by oxford university press in 1934 in a book titled the reconstruction of religious thought in islam . 
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society , but that india 's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage , culture and political influence . 
iqbal expressed fears that not only would secularism and secular nationalism weaken the spiritual foundations of islam and muslim society , but that india 's hindu-majority population would crowd out muslim heritage , culture and political influence . 
in his travels to egypt , afghanistan , palestine and syria , he promoted ideas of greater islamic political co-operation and unity , calling for the shedding of nationalist differences . 
sir muhammad iqbal was elected president of the muslim league in 1930 at its session in allahabad as well as for the session in lahore in 1932 . 
this address later inspired the pakistan movement . 
sayyid abul ala maududi was an important early twentieth-century figure in the islamic revival in india , and then after independence from britain , in pakistan . 
trained as a lawyer he chose the profession of journalism , and wrote about contemporary issues and most importantly about islam and islamic law . 
maududi founded the jamaat-e-islami party in 1941 and remained its leader until 1972 . 
however , maududi had much more impact through his writing than through his political organising . 
his extremely influential books -lrb- translated into many languages -rrb- placed islam in a modern context , and influenced not only conservative ulema but liberal modernizer islamists such as al-faruqi , whose `` islamization of knowledge '' carried forward some of maududi 's key principles .

roughly contemporaneous with maududi was the founding of the muslim brotherhood in ismailiyah , egypt in 1928 by hassan al banna . 
under the motto `` the qur ` an is our constitution , '' it sought islamic revival through preaching and also by providing basic community services including schools , mosques , and workshops . 
like maududi , al banna believed in the necessity of government rule based on shariah law implemented gradually and by persuasion , and of eliminating all imperialist influence in the muslim world . 
some elements of the brotherhood , though perhaps against orders , did engage in violence against the government , and its founder al-banna was assassinated in 1949 in retaliation for the assassination of egypt 's premier mahmud fami naqrashi three months earlier .

despite periodic repression , the brotherhood has become one of the most influential movements in the islamic world , particularly in the arab world . 
in the egyptian parliamentary election , 2011 -- 2012 , the political parties identified as `` islamist '' -lrb- the brotherhood 's freedom and justice party , salafi al-nour party and liberal islamist al-wasat party -rrb- won 75 % of the total seats .

a steep and steady decline in the popularity and credibility of secular , socialist and nationalist politics ensued . 
ba'athism , arab socialism , and arab nationalism suffered , and different democratic and anti-democratic islamist movements inspired by maududi and sayyid qutb gained ground .

the conflict , pitting indigenous impoverished muslims -lrb- mujahideen -rrb- against an anti-religious superpower , galvanized thousands of muslims around the world to send aid and sometimes to go themselves to fight for their faith .

prior to 1990 saudi arabia played an important role in restraining the many islamist groups that received its aid . 
but when saddam , secularist and ba'athist dictator of neighboring iraq , attacked saudi arabia -lrb- his enemy in the war -rrb- , western troops came to protect the saudi monarchy . 
islamists accused the saudi regime of being a puppet of the west . 
these attacks resonated with conservative muslims and the problem did not go away with saddam 's defeat either , since american troops remained stationed in the kingdom , and a de facto cooperation with the palestinian-israeli peace process developed . 
saudi arabia attempted to compensate for its loss of prestige among these groups by repressing those domestic islamists who attacked it -lrb- bin laden being a prime example -rrb- , and increasing aid to islamic groups -lrb- islamist madrassas around the world and even aiding some violent islamist groups -rrb- that did not , but its pre-war influence on behalf of moderation was greatly reduced .

for some decades prior to the first palestine intifada in 1987 , the muslim brotherhood in palestine took a `` quiescent '' stance towards israel , focusing on preaching , education and social services , and benefiting from israel 's `` indulgence '' to build up a network of mosques and charitable organizations . 
as the first intifada gathered momentum and palestinian shopkeepers closed their shops in support of the uprising , the brotherhood announced the formation of hamas -lrb- `` zeal '' -rrb- , devoted to jihad against israel . 
rather than being more moderate than the plo , the 1988 hamas charter took a more uncompromising stand , calling for the destruction of israel and the establishment of an islamic state in palestine . 
the brotherhood 's base of devout middle class found common cause with the impoverished youth of the intifada in their cultural conservatism and antipathy for activities of the secular middle class such as drinking alcohol and going about without hijab .

from 2000 to 2007 it killed 542 people in 140 suicide bombing or `` martyrdom operations '' .

his national islamic front first gained influence when strongman general gaafar al-nimeiry invited members to serve in his government in 1979 . 
turabi built a powerful economic base with money from foreign islamist banking systems , especially those linked with saudi arabia . 
he also recruited and built a cadre of influential loyalists by placing sympathetic students in the university and military academy while serving as minister of education . 
after al-nimeiry was overthrown in 1985 the party did poorly in national elections , but in 1989 it was able to overthrow the elected post-al-nimeiry government with the help of the military .

taking advantage of economic failure and unpopular social liberalization and secularization by the ruling leftist-nationalist fln government , it used its preaching to advocate the establishment of a legal system following sharia law , economic liberalization and development program , education in arabic rather than french , and gender segregation , with women staying home to alleviate the high rate of unemployment among young algerian men .

their ideology was also described as being influenced by wahhabism , and the extremist jihadism of their guest osama bin laden . 
in july 1977 , general zia-ul-haq overthrew prime minister zulfiqar ali bhutto 's regime in pakistan . 
ali bhutto , a leftist in democratic competition with islamists , had announced banning alcohol and nightclubs within six months , shortly before he was overthrown . 
zia-ul-haq was much more committed to islamism , and `` islamization '' or implementation of islamic law , became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dictatorship and islamism became his `` official state ideology '' . 
in pakistan this islamization from above was `` probably '' more complete `` than under any other regime except those in iran and sudan , '' but zia-ul-haq was also criticized by many islamists for imposing `` symbols '' rather than substance , and using islamization to legitimize his means of seizing power . 
zia-ul-haq was killed in 1988 but islamization remains an important element in pakistani society .

christian whiton , an official in the george w. bush administration , called for a new agency focused on the nonviolent practice of `` political warfare '' aimed at undermining the ideology . 
u.s. defense secretary robert gates called for establishing something similar to the defunct u.s. information agency , which was charged with undermining the communist ideology during the cold war .

its name originated from the latin word `` imperium '' , which means to rule over large territories . 
imperialism is `` a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through colonization , use of military force , or other means '' . 
the term imperialism has been applied to western -lrb- and japanese -rrb- political and economic dominance especially in asia and africa in the 19th and 20th centuries . 
it has also allowed for the rapid spread of technologies and ideas . 
imperialism is defined as `` a policy of extending a country 's power and influence through diplomacy or military force . '' 
`` formal imperialism '' is defined as `` physical control or full-fledged colonial rule '' . 
this is often through various forms of `` othering '' -lrb- see other -rrb- based on racial , religious , or cultural stereotypes . 
`` informal imperialism '' is less direct ; however , it is still a powerful form of dominance . 
to clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of `` formal '' and `` informal '' imperialism , the first meaning physical control or `` full-fledged colonial rule '' while the second implied less direct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance .

the definition of imperialism has not been finalized for centuries and was confusedly seen to represent the policies of major powers , or simply , general-purpose aggressiveness . 
this is because , with informal rule , the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority , enforcing land officials into large debts that can not be repaid , ownership of private industries thus expanding the controlled area , or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully .

the greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded . 
european expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory . 
the russian leader lenin suggested that `` imperialism was the highest form of capitalism , claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism , and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism '' . 
geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market ; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations . 
european empires in asia and africa `` have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism : and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the european seaborne empires '' . 
the term `` imperialism '' is often conflated with `` colonialism '' , however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition . 
contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism. :116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus . 
robert young writes that while imperialism operates from the center , is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons , colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions . 
contiguous land empires such as the russian or ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism. :116 thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism , but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism , as it lacks a political focus . 
imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one 's superiority , domination and influence upon a person or group of people . 
imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control , yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two . 
although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other , if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another , imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance , either formally or informally . 
the meaning of imperialism is to create an empire , by conquering the other state 's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance . 
colonialism 's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war . 
colonialism can completely change the existing social structure , physical structure and economics of an area ; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations . 
a controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds . 
friedrich ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive , imperialism was needed . 
j. a. hobson identifies this justification on general grounds as : `` it is desirable that the earth should be peopled , governed , and developed , as far as possible , by the races which can do this work best , i.e. by the races of highest ` social efficiency ' '' . 
the purportedly scientific nature of `` social darwinism '' and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism . 
the rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose , for example throughout latin america `` whiteness '' is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento -lrb- whitening -rrb- are common .

geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance . 
for instance , american geographer ellen churchill semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone . 
tropicality can be paralleled with edward said 's orientalism as the west 's construction of the east as the `` other '' . 
geographical theories such as environmental determinism also suggested that tropical environments created uncivilized people in need of european guidance . 
according to siad , orientalism allowed europe to establish itself as the superior and the norm , which justified its dominance over the essentialized orient . 
british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius -lrb- latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'em pty land ' -rrb- . 
the country of australia serves as a case study in relation to british settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the eighteenth century , as it was premised on terra nullius , and its settlers considered it unused by its sparse aboriginal inhabitants . 
the principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the british empire `` during the last generation , and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description '' .

british imperialism often used the concept of terra nullius -lrb- latin expression which stems from roman law meaning 'em pty land ' -rrb- . 
orientalism , as theorized by edward said , refers to how the west developed an imaginative geography of the east . 
this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west . 
defining the east as a negative vision of itself , as its inferior , not only increased the west 's sense of self , but also was a way of ordering the east and making it known to the west so that it could be dominated and controlled . 
the discourse of orientalism therefore served as an ideological justification of early western imperialism , as it formed a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social , cultural , political , and economic control of other territories . 
this difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early european studies of the orient that positioned the east as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive west . 
to better illustrate this idea , bassett focuses his analysis of the role of nineteenth-century maps during the `` scramble for africa '' . 
this provided incentives for imperial and colonial powers to obtain `` information to fill in blank spaces on contemporary maps '' . 
during his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory . 
during his analysis of nineteenth-century cartographic techniques , he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory . 
he states that maps `` contributed to empire by promoting , assisting , and legitimizing the extension of french and british power into west africa '' . 
the americas during the pre-columbian era also had large empires such as the aztec empire and the incan empire . 
imperialism was a basic component to the conquests of genghis khan during the mongol empire , and of other war-lords . 
sub-saharan africa has also featured dozens of empires that predate the european colonial era , for example the ethiopian empire , oyo empire , asante union , luba empire , lunda empire , and mutapa empire .

cultural imperialism is when a country 's influence is felt in social and cultural circles , i.e. its soft power , such that it changes the moral , cultural and societal worldview of another . 
the importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes , fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture , control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. . 
for example , depictions of opulent american lifestyles in the soap opera dallas during the cold war changed the expectations of romanians ; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled south korean drama series in north korea . 
nor is such a usage of culture recent , as part of roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of roman culture and lifestyle , with the aim that they would then become willing participants .

europe 's expansion into territorial imperialism was largely focused on economic growth by collecting resources from colonies , in combination with assuming political control by military and political means . 
the colonization of india in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus : there , the `` british exploited the political weakness of the mughal state , and , while military activity was important at various times , the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance '' for the establishment of control over the subcontinent 's resources , markets , and manpower .

along with advancements in communication , europe also continued to advance in military technology . 
european chemists made deadly explosives that could be used in combat , and with innovations in machinery they were able to manufacture improved firearms . 
by the 1880s , the machine gun had become an effective battlefield weapon . 
this technology gave european armies an advantage over their opponents , as armies in less-developed countries were still fighting with arrows , swords , and leather shields -lrb- e.g. the zulus in southern africa during the anglo-zulu war of 1879 -rrb- .

in anglophone academic works , theories regarding imperialism are often based on the british experience . 
the term `` imperialism '' was originally introduced into english in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of british prime minister benjamin disraeli . 
for some , imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy ; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest , and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed . 
in his writings lenin portrayed imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment , material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion . 
the correlation between capitalism , aristocracy , and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists . 
their combined work informed the study of imperialism and it 's impact on europe , as well as contributed to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the united states from the 1950s . 
while these non-marxist writers were at their most prolific before world war i , they remained active in the interwar years . 
hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation . 
hobson theorized that state intervention through taxation could boost broader consumption , create wealth , and encourage a peaceful , tolerant , multipolar world order . 
the concept environmental determinism served as a moral justification for domination of certain territories and peoples . 
it was believed that a certain person 's behaviours were determined by the environment in which they lived and thus validated their domination . 
for example , people living in tropical environments were seen as `` less civilized '' therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission . 
across the three waves of european colonialism -lrb- first in the americas , second in asia and lastly in africa -rrb- , environmental determinism was used to categorically place indigenous people in a racial hierarchy . 
this takes two forms , orientalism and tropicality . 
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires , the world could be split into climatic zones . 
these scholars believed that northern europe and the mid-atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working , moral , and upstanding human being . 
the people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from the european empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure ; they were seen as incapable of such a feat . 
similarly , orientalism is a view of a people based on their geographical location . 
according to geographic scholars under colonizing empires , the world could be split into climatic zones .

in world war ii , charles de gaulle and the free french used the overseas colonies as bases from which they fought to liberate france . 
however after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the empire . 
france fought and lost a bitter war in vietnam in the 1950s . 
whereas they won the war in algeria , the french leader at the time , charles de gaulle , decided to grant algeria independence anyway in 1962 . 
nearly all of france 's colonies gained independence by 1960 , but france retained great financial and diplomatic influence .

the soviet union and the people 's republic of china supported post -- world war ii communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests , but were not always successful . 
never formally revoked , it stopped being implemented after 1932 .

trotsky , and others , believed that the revolution could only succeed in russia as part of a world revolution . 
lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism . 
mao zedong once argued that the soviet union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade . 
with the beginning of the new era , the after stalin period called the `` thaw '' , in the late 1950s , the new political leader nikita khrushchev put even more pressure on the soviet-american relations starting a new wave of anti-imperialist propaganda . 
however , after lenin 's death , joseph stalin established ` socialism in one country ' for the soviet union , creating the model for subsequent inward looking stalinist states and purging the early internationalist elements . 
the first british empire was based on mercantilism , and involved colonies and holdings primarily in north america , the caribbean , and india . 
its growth was reversed by the loss of the american colonies in 1776 . 
by the 1840s , britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world . 
britain made compensating gains in india , australia , and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in latin america after the independence of spanish and portuguese colonies about 1820 . 
following the defeat of napoleonic france in 1815 , britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe . 
the british empire was the largest empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population . 
the pseudo-sciences of social darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning during this time . 
the british spirit of imperialism was expressed by joseph chamberlain and lord rosebury , and implemented in africa by cecil rhodes . 
a resurgence came in the late 19th century , with the scramble for africa and major additions in asia and the middle east . 
the early united states expressed its opposition to imperialism , at least in a form distinct from its own manifest destiny , through policies such as the monroe doctrine . 
however , beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century , policies such as theodore roosevelt 's interventionism in central america and woodrow wilson 's mission to `` make the world safe for democracy '' changed all this . 
one year later , a war erupted in the philippines causing business , labor and government leaders in the us to condemn america 's occupation in the philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many filipinos . 
in 1898 , americans who opposed imperialism created the anti-imperialist league to oppose the us annexation of the philippines and cuba . 
american foreign policy was denounced as a `` racket '' by smedley butler , an american general . 
one key figure in the plans for what would come to be known as american empire , was a geographer named isiah bowman . 
three years later in 1917 , he was appointed to then president woodrow wilson 's inquiry in 1917 . 
the inquiry was the idea of president wilson and the american delegation from the paris peace conference . 
the point of this inquiry was to build a premise that would allow for u.s authorship of a ` new world ' which was to be characterized by geographical order . 
as a result of his role in the inquiry , isiah bowman would come to be known as wilson 's geographer . 
some have described the internal strife between various people groups as a form of imperialism or colonialism . 
this internal form of empire has been referred to as `` internal colonialism '' . 
participation in the african slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of america 's `` internal colonialism '' . 
in his lecture on april 16 , 2003 , edward said made a bold statement on modern imperialism in the united states , whom he described as using aggressive means of attack towards the contemporary orient , `` due to their backward living , lack of democracy and the violation of women 's rights . 
the ottoman empire was an imperial state that lasted from 1299 to 1923 . 
during the 16th and 17th centuries , in particular at the height of its power under the reign of suleiman the magnificent , the ottoman empire was a powerful multinational , multilingual empire controlling much of southeast europe , western asia , the caucasus , north africa , and the horn of africa .

with istanbul as its capital and control of lands around the mediterranean basin , the ottoman empire was at the center of interactions between the eastern and western worlds for six centuries . 
the empire allied with germany in the early 20th century , with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories , but it dissolved in the aftermath of world war i , leading to the emergence of the new state of turkey in the ottoman anatolian heartland , as well as the creation of modern balkan and middle eastern states , thus ending turkish colonial ambitions .

the united methodist church understands itself to be part of the holy catholic -lrb- or universal -rrb- church and it recognizes the historic ecumenical creeds , the apostle 's creed and the nicene creed ; which are used frequently in services of worship . 
the book of discipline also recognizes the importance of the chalcedonian creed of the council of chalcedon . 
it upholds the concept of the `` visible and invisible church , '' meaning that all who are truly believers in every age belong to the holy church invisible , while the united methodist church is a branch of the church visible , to which all believers must be connected as it is the only institution wherein the word of god is preached and the sacraments are administered .

with the formation of the united methodist church in 1968 , theologian albert c. outler led the team which systematized denominational doctrine . 
although united methodist practices and interpretation of beliefs have evolved over time , these practices and beliefs can be traced to the writings of the church 's founders , especially john wesley and charles wesley -lrb- anglicans -rrb- , but also philip william otterbein and martin boehm -lrb- united brethren -rrb- , and jacob albright -lrb- evangelical association -rrb- .

prevenient grace allows those tainted by sin to nevertheless make a truly free choice to accept or reject god 's salvation in christ . 
justifying grace or accepting grace is that grace , offered by god to all people , that we receive by faith and trust in christ , through which god pardons the believer of sin . 
the justifying grace cancels our guilt and empowers us to resist the power of sin and to fully love god and neighbor . 
today , justifying grace is also known as conversion , `` accepting jesus as your personal lord and savior , '' or being `` born again '' .

wesleyan theology stands at a unique cross-roads between evangelical and sacramental , between liturgical and charismatic , and between anglo-catholic and reformed theology and practice . 
the united methodist church believes in prima scriptura , seeing the holy bible as the primary authority in the church and using sacred tradition , reason , and experience to interpret it , with the aid of the holy spirit -lrb- see wesleyan quadrilateral -rrb- . 
today , the umc is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race , gender , and ideology , though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes . 
therefore , according to the book of discipline , united methodist theology is at once `` catholic , evangelical , and reformed . '' 
still , the denomination is pro-choice and also `` was a founding member of the religious coalition for reproductive choice ... -lsb- and -rsb- 2008 general conference -lsb- went -rsb- on record in support of the work of the religious coalition for reproductive choice '' .

still , the denomination is pro-choice and also `` was a founding member of the religious coalition for reproductive choice ... -lsb- and -rsb- 2008 general conference -lsb- went -rsb- on record in support of the work of the religious coalition for reproductive choice '' . 
as such , two official bodies of the united methodist church are part of the religious coalition for reproductive choice 's governing coalition , the general board of church and society , and the united methodist women . 
the church emphasizes the need to be in supportive ministry with all women , regardless of their choice . 
the church also holds that they `` are equally bound to respect the sacredness of the life and well-being of the mother , for whom devastating damage may result from an unacceptable pregnancy . 
members of the united methodist church who identify with the pro-life position have organized into the taskforce of united methodists on abortion and sexuality -lrb- tumas -rrb- to further their position within the denomination . 
there was an attempt to withdraw the united methodist church membership in the religious coalition for reproductive choice at their general conference , held in may 2012 , with a petition that passed through the legislative subcommittee and committee votes , but was not given a floor vote . 
rev. paul t. stallsworth , president of the taskforce of united methodists on abortion and sexuality said he `` had every reason to believe '' that pro-life delegates would have won a floor vote . 
historically , the methodist church has supported the temperance movement . 
moreover , in 2011 and 2012 , the united methodist church 's general board of church and society called on all united methodists to abstain from alcohol for lent . 
john wesley warned against the dangers of drinking in his famous sermon , `` the use of money , '' and in his letter to an alcoholic . 
in fact , the united methodist church uses unfermented grape juice in the sacrament of holy communion , thus `` expressing pastoral concern for recovering alcoholics , enabling the participation of children and youth , and supporting the church 's witness of abstinence . '' 
the united methodist church , along with other methodist churches , condemns capital punishment , saying that it can not accept retribution or social vengeance as a reason for taking human life . 
the united methodist church also believes that jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in matthew 5:38 -39 and abolished the death penalty in john 8:7 . 
the united methodist church also believes that jesus explicitly repudiated the lex talionis in matthew 5:38 -39 and abolished the death penalty in john 8:7 . 
the general conference of the united methodist church calls for its bishops to uphold opposition to capital punishment and for governments to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty sentence . 
in addition , the united methodist church prohibits the celebration of same-sex unions . 
rev. jimmy creech was defrocked after a highly publicized church trial in 1999 on account of his participation in same-sex union ceremonies . 
moreover , some churches , especially in 2016 after same-sex marriage was legalized nationwide , have provided blessings for same-sex marriages . 
for example , the connectional table , a governing committee , has voted in favor of a proposal that calls for a localized option , which would permit ministers to officiate same-sex weddings , and it would allow conferences to ordain gay clergy . 
additionally , many organizations , conferences , and congregations have recently called for broader acceptance of the lgbt community within the umc . 
moreover , many conferences have taken a position by voting in favor of same-gender marriages with resolutions . 
in 1987 , a united methodist church court in new hampshire defrocked methodist minister rose mary denman for openly living with a same-sex partner . 
in 2005 , clergy credentials were removed from irene elizabeth stroud after she was convicted in a church trial of violating church law by engaging in a lesbian relationship ; this conviction was later upheld by the judicial council , the highest court in the denomination . 
the baltimore-washington conference of the umc has approved the appointment of an openly partnered lesbian to the provisional diaconate . 
the united methodist church opposes conscription as incompatible with the teaching of scripture . 
the church also states that `` as christians they are aware that neither the way of military action , nor the way of inaction is always righteous before god . '' 
therefore , the church supports and extends its ministry to those persons who conscientiously oppose all war , or any particular war , and who therefore refuse to serve in the armed forces or to cooperate with systems of military conscription . 
the united methodist church maintains that war is incompatible with christ 's message and teachings . 
therefore , the church rejects war as an instrument of national foreign policy , to be employed only as a last resort in the prevention of such evils as genocide , brutal suppression of human rights , and unprovoked international aggression . 
consequently , the united methodist church endorses general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control . 
the sexual ethics task force of the united methodist church states that `` research shows it -lsb- pornography -rsb- is not an ` innocent activity . ' 
the united methodist church teaches that pornography is `` about violence , degradation , exploitation , and coercion '' and `` deplore -lsb- s -rsb- all forms of commercialization , abuse , and exploitation of sex . '' 
persons who are addicted to pornography are physiologically altered , as is their perspective , relationships with parishioners and family , and their perceptions of girls and women . '' 
the umc supports federal funding for research on embryos created for ivf that remain after the procreative efforts have ceased , if the embryos were provided for research instead of being destroyed , were not obtained by sale , and those donating had given prior informed consent for the research purposes . 
it supports research on stem cells retrieved from umbilical cords and adult stem cells , stating that there are `` few moral questions '' raised by this issue . 
the umc stands in `` opposition to the creation of embryos for the sake of research '' as `` a human embryo , even at its earliest stages , commands our reverence . ''

some clergy offer healing services , while exorcism is an occasional practice by some clergy in the united methodist church in africa . 
many of these liturgies are derived from the anglican tradition 's book of common prayer . 
these services involve the laying on of hands and anointing with oil . 
methodist institutions may be named after a biblical figure -lrb- e.g. , `` st. james umc '' -rrb- . 
such exemplary saints include martyrs , confessors of the faith , evangelists , or important biblical figures such as saint matthew , lutheran theologian and martyr to the nazis dietrich bonhoeffer , salvation army founder william booth , african missionary david livingstone and methodism 's revered founder john wesley are among many cited as protestant saints .

the annual conference , roughly the equivalent of a diocese in the anglican communion and the roman catholic church or a synod in some lutheran denominations such as the evangelical lutheran church in america , is the basic unit of organization within the umc . 
the term annual conference is often used to refer to the geographical area it covers as well as the frequency of meeting . 
clergy are members of their annual conference rather than of any local congregation , and are appointed to a local church or other charge annually by the conference 's resident bishop at the meeting of the annual conference . 
the book of discipline is the guidebook for local churches and pastors and describes in considerable detail the organizational structure of local united methodist churches . 
all um churches must have a board of trustees with at least three members and no more than nine members and it is recommended that no gender should hold more than a 2/3 majority .

as such , the united methodist church established and is affiliated with around one hundred colleges and universities in the united states , including syracuse university , boston university , emory university , duke university , drew university , university of denver , university of evansville , and southern methodist university . 
the church operates three hundred sixty schools and institutions overseas . 
most are members of the international association of methodist-related schools , colleges , and universities . 
the first methodist clergy were ordained by john wesley , a priest of the church of england , because of the crisis caused by the american revolution which isolated the methodists in the states from the church of england and its sacraments . 
they generally serve as pastors in local congregations . 
elders in full connection are each a member of their annual conference order of elders . 
likewise each deacon in full connection is a member of their annual conference order of deacons . 
all clergy appointments are made and fixed annually by the resident bishop on the advice of the annual conference cabinet , which is composed of the area provost/dean -lrb- if one is appointed -rrb- and the several district superintendents of the districts of the annual conference . 
while an appointment is made one year at a time , it is most common for an appointment to be continued for multiple years . 
until the bishop has read the appointments at the session of the annual conference , no appointments are officially fixed . 
elders are called by god , affirmed by the church , and ordained by a bishop to a ministry of word , sacrament , order and service within the church . 
they may be appointed to the local church , or to other valid extension ministries of the church . 
elders serve a term of 2 -- 3 years as provisional elders prior to their ordination . 
elders may also be assigned as district superintendents , and they are eligible for election to the episcopacy .

a local pastor 's official title is ` licensed local pastor ' and is appointed as clergy to the local church where they preach , conduct divine worship and perform the regular duties of a pastor . 
the licensed local pastor has the authority of a pastor only within the context and during the time of the appointment and shall not extend beyond it . 
local pastors are not required to have advanced degrees but are required to attend licensing school and attend and pass an approved five-year course of study at an approved united methodist seminary or course of study school , successfully complete written and oral examinations , and appear before the district committee on ministry and the conference board of ordained ministry . 
they may continue towards associate membership allowing them to retire as clergy . 
baptized members are those who have been baptized as an infant or child , but who have not subsequently professed their own faith . 
these baptized members become professing members through confirmation and sometimes the profession of faith . 
individuals may also become a professing member through transfer from another christian denomination . 
unlike confirmation and profession of faith , baptism is a sacrament in the umc .

the united methodist church is one tradition within the christian church . 
in addition , it voted to seek observer status in the national association of evangelicals and in the world evangelical fellowship . 
however , there are some in the united methodist church who feel that false ecumenism might result in the `` blurring of theological and confessional differences in the interests of unity . '' 
a commission on pan methodist cooperation and union formed in 2000 to carry out work on such a merger . 
in may 2012 , the united methodist church entered into full communion with the african methodist episcopal church , african methodist episcopal zion church , african union methodist protestant church , christian methodist episcopal church , and union american methodist episcopal church , in which these churches agreed to `` recognize each other 's churches , share sacraments , and affirm their clergy and ministries .

the french and indian war -lrb- 1754 -- 1763 -rrb- was the north american theater of the worldwide seven years ' war . 
the war was fought between the colonies of british america and new france , with both sides supported by military units from their parent countries of great britain and france , as well as native american allies . 
at the start of the war , the french north american colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 european settlers , compared with 2 million in the british north american colonies . 
at the start of the war , the french north american colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 european settlers , compared with 2 million in the british north american colonies . 
the war was fought primarily along the frontiers between new france and the british colonies , from virginia in the south to nova scotia in the north . 
it began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the allegheny and monongahela rivers , called the forks of the ohio , and the site of the french fort duquesne and present-day pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 
the dispute erupted into violence in the battle of jumonville glen in may 1754 , during which virginia militiamen under the command of 22-year-old george washington ambushed a french patrol . 
in 1755 , six colonial governors in north america met with general edward braddock , the newly arrived british army commander , and planned a four-way attack on the french . 
none succeeded and the main effort by braddock was a disaster ; he was defeated in the battle of the monongahela on july 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . 
british operations in 1755 , 1756 and 1757 in the frontier areas of pennsylvania and new york all failed , due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , and effective canadian scouts , french regular forces , and indian warrior allies . 
in 1755 , the british captured fort beauséjour on the border separating nova scotia from acadia ; soon afterward they ordered the expulsion of the acadians .

france concentrated its forces against prussia and its allies in the european theatre of the war . 
though the british were later defeated at sainte foy in quebec , the french ceded canada in accordance with the 1763 treaty . 
france ceded its territory east of the mississippi to great britain . 
it ceded french louisiana west of the mississippi river -lrb- including new orleans -rrb- to its ally spain , in compensation for spain 's loss to britain of florida -lrb- spain had ceded this to britain in exchange for the return of havana , cuba -rrb- . 
france 's colonial presence north of the caribbean was reduced to the islands of saint pierre and miquelon , confirming britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern north america . 
as there had already been a king george 's war in the 1740s , british colonists named the second war in king george 's reign after their opponents , and it became known as the french and indian war . 
this traditional name continues as the standard in the united states , but it obscures the fact that indians fought on both sides of the conflict , and that this was part of the seven years ' war , a much larger conflict between france and great britain .

while their population centers were along the coast , the settlements were growing into the interior . 
in between the french and the british , large areas were dominated by native tribes . 
to the north , the mi ` kmaq and the abenaki were engaged in father le loutre 's war and still held sway in parts of nova scotia , acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of canada , as well as much of present-day maine . 
the iroquois confederation dominated much of present-day upstate new york and the ohio country , although the latter also included algonquian-speaking populations of delaware and shawnee , as well as iroquoian-speaking mingo . 
these tribes were formally under iroquois rule , and were limited by them in authority to make agreements . 
further south the southeast interior was dominated by siouan-speaking catawba , muskogee-speaking creek and choctaw , and the iroquoian-speaking cherokee tribes . 
when war broke out , the french used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the great lakes region -lrb- an area not directly subject to the conflict between the french and british -rrb- , including the huron , mississauga , ojibwa , winnebago , and potawatomi . 
the british were supported in the war by the iroquois six nations , and also by the cherokee -- until differences sparked the anglo-cherokee war in 1758 . 
at the start of the war , no french regular army troops were stationed in north america , and few british troops . 
at the start of the war , no french regular army troops were stationed in north america , and few british troops . 
most british colonies mustered local militia companies , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , to deal with native threats , but did not have any standing forces . 
the expedition covered about 3,000 miles -lrb- 4,800 km -rrb- between june and november 1749 . 
céloron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 troupes de la marine and 30 indians . 
whenever he encountered british merchants or fur-traders , céloron informed them of the french claims on the territory and told them to leave . 
when céloron 's expedition arrived at logstown , the native americans in the area informed céloron that they owned the ohio country and that they would trade with the british regardless of the french . 
céloron continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the ohio and the miami rivers , which lay just south of the village of pickawillany , the home of the miami chief known as `` old briton '' . 
céloron threatened `` old briton '' with severe consequences if he continued to trade with the british . 
`` old briton '' ignored the warning . 
in his extensively detailed report , céloron wrote , `` all i can say is that the natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the french , and are entirely devoted to the english . 
even before his return to montreal , reports on the situation in the ohio country were making their way to london and paris , each side proposing that action be taken . 
william shirley , the expansionist governor of the province of massachusetts bay , was particularly forceful , stating that british colonists would not be safe as long as the french were present . 
in 1749 the british government gave land to the ohio company of virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the ohio country .

in 1750 christopher gist , acting on behalf of both virginia and the company , explored the ohio territory and opened negotiations with the indian tribes at logstown . 
he completed the 1752 treaty of logstown in which the local indians , through their `` half-king '' tanacharison and an iroquois representative , agreed to terms that included permission to build a `` strong house '' at the mouth of the monongahela river -lrb- the site of present-day pittsburgh , pennsylvania -rrb- .

the war of the austrian succession -lrb- whose north american theater is known as king george 's war -rrb- formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the treaty of aix-la-chapelle .

the issues of conflicting territorial claims between british and french colonies in north america were turned over to a commission to resolve , but it reached no decision . 
frontiers from between nova scotia and acadia in the north , to the ohio country in the south , were claimed by both sides . 
on march 17 , 1752 , the governor-general of new france , marquis de la jonquière , died and was temporarily replaced by charles le moyne de longueuil . 
langlade was given 300 men , including french-canadians and warriors of the ottawa . 
his objective was to punish the miami people of pickawillany for not following céloron 's orders to cease trading with the british . 
on june 21 , the french war party attacked the trading centre at pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 people of the miami nation , including old briton . 
in the spring of 1753 , paul marin de la malgue was given command of a 2,000-man force of troupes de la marine and indians . 
he first constructed fort presque isle -lrb- near present-day erie , pennsylvania -rrb- on lake erie 's south shore . 
marin constructed a second fort at fort le boeuf -lrb- present-day waterford , pennsylvania -rrb- , designed to guard the headwaters of leboeuf creek . 
his orders were to protect the king 's land in the ohio valley from the british . 
tanaghrisson , a chief of the mingo , who were remnants of iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion . 
the british superintendent for indian affairs in the new york region and beyond , johnson was known to the iroquois as warraghiggey , meaning `` he who does great things . '' 
the british superintendent for indian affairs in the new york region and beyond , johnson was known to the iroquois as warraghiggey , meaning `` he who does great things . '' 
in 1746 , johnson was made a colonel of the iroquois . 
mohawk chief hendrick , speaker of their tribal council , insisted that the british abide by their obligations and block french expansion . 
governor robert dinwiddie of virginia was an investor in the ohio company , which stood to lose money if the french held their claim . 
to counter the french military presence in ohio , in october 1753 dinwiddie ordered the 21-year-old major george washington -lrb- whose brother was another ohio company investor -rrb- of the virginia regiment to warn the french to leave virginia territory . 
washington left with a small party , picking up along the way jacob van braam as an interpreter ; christopher gist , a company surveyor working in the area ; and a few mingo led by tanaghrisson . 
on december 12 , washington and his men reached fort le boeuf . 
jacques legardeur de saint-pierre , who succeeded marin as commander of the french forces after the latter died on october 29 , invited washington to dine with him . 
over dinner , washington presented saint-pierre with the letter from dinwiddie demanding an immediate french withdrawal from the ohio country . 
saint-pierre said , `` as to the summons you send me to retire , i do not think myself obliged to obey it . '' 
he told washington that france 's claim to the region was superior to that of the british , since rené-robert cavelier , sieur de la salle had explored the ohio country nearly a century earlier . 
governor duquesne sent additional french forces under claude-pierre pecaudy de contrecœur to relieve saint-pierre during the same period , and contrecœur led 500 men south from fort venango on april 5 , 1754 . 
even before washington returned , dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under william trent to that point , where in the early months of 1754 they began construction of a small stockaded fort . 
he purchased their construction tools to continue building what became fort duquesne . 
learning of a french scouting party in the area , washington , with tanaghrisson and his party , surprised the canadians on may 28 in what became known as the battle of jumonville glen . 
they killed many of the canadians , including their commanding officer , joseph coulon de jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by tanaghrisson with a tomahawk . 
the historian fred anderson suggests that tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the british and regain authority over his own people . 
after several months of negotiations , the government of the duke of newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the french . 
word of the british military plans leaked to france well before braddock 's departure for north america . 
in response , king louis xv dispatched six regiments to new france under the command of baron dieskau in 1755 . 
the british , intending to blockade french ports , sent out their fleet in february 1755 , but the french fleet had already sailed . 
an early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the albany congress in june and july , 1754 . 
the goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the success in the war that was unfolding . 
the plan that the delegates agreed to was never ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown . 
nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the war of independence . 
braddock -lrb- with george washington as one of his aides -rrb- led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in june 1755 to take fort duquesne . 
the expedition was a disaster . 
approximately 1,000 british soldiers were killed or injured . 
two future opponents in the american revolutionary war , washington and thomas gage , played key roles in organizing the retreat . 
the french acquired a copy of the british war plans , including the activities of shirley and johnson . 
shirley 's efforts to fortify oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by shirley 's inexperience in managing large expeditions . 
in conjunction , shirley was made aware that the french were massing for an attack on fort oswego in his absence when he planned to attack fort niagara . 
as a response , shirley left garrisons at oswego , fort bull , and fort williams -lrb- the latter two located on the oneida carry between the mohawk river and wood creek at present-day rome , new york -rrb- . 
johnson 's expedition was better organized than shirley 's , which was noticed by new france 's governor , the marquis de vaudreuil . 
when johnson was seen as the larger threat , vaudreuil sent dieskau to fort st. frédéric to meet that threat . 
the battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field . 
johnson 's advance stopped at fort william henry , and the french withdrew to ticonderoga point , where they began the construction of fort carillon -lrb- later renamed fort ticonderoga after british capture in 1759 -rrb- .

colonel monckton , in the sole british success that year , captured fort beauséjour in june 1755 , cutting the french fortress at louisbourg off from land-based reinforcements . 
to cut vital supplies to louisbourg , nova scotia 's governor charles lawrence ordered the deportation of the french-speaking acadian population from the area . 
other than the campaigns to expel the acadians -lrb- ranging around the bay of fundy , on the petitcodiac and st. john rivers , and île saint-jean -rrb- , the only clashes of any size were at petitcodiac in 1755 and at bloody creek near annapolis royal in 1757 . 
following the death of braddock , william shirley assumed command of british forces in north america . 
at a meeting in albany in december 1755 , he laid out his plans for 1756 . 
in addition to renewing the efforts to capture niagara , crown point and duquesne , he proposed attacks on fort frontenac on the north shore of lake ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the maine district and down the chaudière river to attack the city of quebec .

newcastle replaced him in january 1756 with lord loudoun , with major general james abercrombie as his second in command . 
french regular army reinforcements arrived in new france in may 1756 , led by major general louis-joseph de montcalm and seconded by the chevalier de lévis and colonel françois-charles de bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the war of the austrian succession . 
during that time in europe , on may 18 , 1756 , england formally declared war on france , which expanded the war into europe , which was later to be known as the seven years ' war . 
scouts had reported the weakness of the british supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts shirley had erected at the oneida carry . 
in the march battle of fort bull , french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder . 
in the march battle of fort bull , french forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder . 
they set back any british hopes for campaigns on lake ontario , and endangered the oswego garrison , already short on supplies . 
when he arrived in albany , abercrombie refused to take any significant actions until loudoun approved them . 
building on vaudreuil 's work harassing the oswego garrison , montcalm executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along lake george . 
with abercrombie pinned down at albany , montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on oswego in august . 
in the aftermath , montcalm and the indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects . 
loudoun , a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack on new france 's capital , quebec . 
leaving a sizable force at fort william henry to distract montcalm , he began organizing for the expedition to quebec . 
he was then ordered by william pitt , the secretary of state responsible for the colonies , to attack louisbourg first . 
faced with this strength , loudoun returned to new york amid news that a massacre had occurred at fort william henry . 
french irregular forces -lrb- canadian scouts and indians -rrb- harassed fort william henry throughout the first half of 1757 . 
in february they launched a daring raid against the position across the frozen lake george , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification . 
when the withdrawal began , some of montcalm 's indian allies , angered at the lost opportunity for loot , attacked the british column , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves . 
vaudreuil and montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the british blockade of the french coastline limited french shipping . 
the situation in new france was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of françois bigot , the intendant of the territory . 
montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the st. lawrence , with primary defenses at carillon , quebec , and louisbourg , while vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years . 
the british failures in north america , combined with other failures in the european theater , led to the fall from power of newcastle and his principal military advisor , the duke of cumberland . 
he embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by loudoun . 
pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops , supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of new france . 
two of the expeditions were successful , with fort duquesne and louisbourg falling to sizable british forces . 
the third invasion was stopped with the improbable french victory in the battle of carillon , in which 3,600 frenchmen famously and decisively defeated abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia and native american allies outside the fort the french called carillon and the british called ticonderoga .

abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent john bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed fort frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for new france 's western forts and furs destined for europe . 
abercrombie was recalled and replaced by jeffery amherst , victor at louisbourg . 
in the aftermath of generally poor french results in most theaters of the seven years ' war in 1758 , france 's new foreign minister , the duc de choiseul , decided to focus on an invasion of britain , to draw british resources away from north america and the european mainland . 
the invasion failed both militarily and politically , as pitt again planned significant campaigns against new france , and sent funds to britain 's ally on the mainland , prussia , and the french navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at lagos and quiberon bay .

british victories continued in all theaters in the annus mirabilis of 1759 , when they finally captured ticonderoga , james wolfe defeated montcalm at quebec -lrb- in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders -rrb- , and victory at fort niagara successfully cut off the french frontier forts further to the west and south .

the victory was made complete in 1760 when , despite losing outside quebec city in the battle of sainte-foy , the british were able to prevent the arrival of french relief ships in the naval battle of the restigouche while armies marched on montreal from three sides .

in september 1760 , and before any hostilities erupted , governor vaudreuil negotiated from montreal a capitulation with general amherst . 
amherst granted vaudreuil 's request that any french residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their roman catholic tradition , continued ownership of their property , and the right to remain undisturbed in their homes .

the british offered france the choice of surrendering either its continental north american possessions east of the mississippi or the caribbean islands of guadeloupe and martinique , which had been occupied by the british . 
they viewed the economic value of the caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent . 
britain gained control of french canada and acadia , colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily french-speaking roman catholic residents . 
the deportation of acadians beginning in 1755 resulted in land made available to migrants from europe and the colonies further south . 
the british resettled many acadians throughout its north american provinces , but many went to france , and some went to new orleans , which they had expected to remain french . 
others migrated to places like saint-domingue , and fled to new orleans after the haitian revolution . 
following the treaty , king george iii issued the royal proclamation of 1763 on october 7 , 1763 , which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and to some extent continues to govern relations between the government of modern canada and the first nations .

included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the appalachian mountains to its indian population , a demarcation that was at best a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward-bound settlers . 
most went to cuba , including the entire governmental records from st. augustine , although some christianized yamasee were resettled to the coast of mexico . 
the ohio country was particularly vulnerable to legal and illegal settlement due to the construction of military roads to the area by braddock and forbes . 
although the spanish takeover of the louisiana territory -lrb- which was not completed until 1769 -rrb- had modest repercussions , the british takeover of spanish florida resulted in the westward migration of tribes that did not want to do business with the british , and a rise in tensions between the choctaw and the creek , historic enemies whose divisions the british at times exploited .

for many native populations , the elimination of french power in north america meant the disappearance of a strong ally and counterweight to british expansion , leading to their ultimate dispossession . 
philosophers in antiquity used the concept of force in the study of stationary and moving objects and simple machines , but thinkers such as aristotle and archimedes retained fundamental errors in understanding force . 
a fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion , even at a constant velocity . 
with his mathematical insight , sir isaac newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years .

by the early 20th century , einstein developed a theory of relativity that correctly predicted the action of forces on objects with increasing momenta near the speed of light , and also provided insight into the forces produced by gravitation and inertia . 
with modern insights into quantum mechanics and technology that can accelerate particles close to the speed of light , particle physics has devised a standard model to describe forces between particles smaller than atoms . 
the standard model predicts that exchanged particles called gauge bosons are the fundamental means by which forces are emitted and absorbed . 
only four main interactions are known : in order of decreasing strength , they are : strong , electromagnetic , weak , and gravitational. :2 -- 10:79 high-energy particle physics observations made during the 1970s and 1980s confirmed that the weak and electromagnetic forces are expressions of a more fundamental electroweak interaction .

aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . 
aristotle provided a philosophical discussion of the concept of a force as an integral part of aristotelian cosmology . 
in aristotle 's view , the terrestrial sphere contained four elements that come to rest at different `` natural places '' therein . 
aristotle believed that motionless objects on earth , those composed mostly of the elements earth and water , to be in their natural place on the ground and that they will stay that way if left alone . 
he distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their `` natural place '' -lrb- e.g. , for heavy bodies to fall -rrb- , which led to `` natural motion '' , and unnatural or forced motion , which required continued application of a force . 
the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus .

the shortcomings of aristotelian physics would not be fully corrected until the 17th century work of galileo galilei , who was influenced by the late medieval idea that objects in forced motion carried an innate force of impetus . 
galileo constructed an experiment in which stones and cannonballs were both rolled down an incline to disprove the aristotelian theory of motion early in the 17th century . 
he showed that the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity unless acted on by a force , for example friction . 
newton 's first law of motion states that objects continue to move in a state of constant velocity unless acted upon by an external net force or resultant force . 
this law is an extension of galileo 's insight that constant velocity was associated with a lack of net force -lrb- see a more detailed description of this below -rrb- . 
newton proposed that every object with mass has an innate inertia that functions as the fundamental equilibrium `` natural state '' in place of the aristotelian idea of the `` natural state of rest '' . 
by making rest physically indistinguishable from non-zero constant velocity , newton 's first law directly connects inertia with the concept of relative velocities . 
in other words , to phrase matters more technically , the laws of physics are the same in every inertial frame of reference , that is , in all frames related by a galilean transformation . 
for instance , while traveling in a moving vehicle at a constant velocity , the laws of physics do not change from being at rest . 
this is true even though another person who is observing the moving vehicle pass by also observes the ball follow a curving parabolic path in the same direction as the motion of the vehicle . 
from the perspective of the person in the car , the vehicle and everything inside of it is at rest : it is the outside world that is moving with a constant speed in the opposite direction . 
inertia therefore applies equally well to constant velocity motion as it does to rest . 
the concept of inertia can be further generalized to explain the tendency of objects to continue in many different forms of constant motion , even those that are not strictly constant velocity . 
the rotational inertia of planet earth is what fixes the constancy of the length of a day and the length of a year . 
albert einstein extended the principle of inertia further when he explained that reference frames subject to constant acceleration , such as those free-falling toward a gravitating object , were physically equivalent to inertial reference frames . 
this is why , for example , astronauts experience weightlessness when in free-fall orbit around the earth , and why newton 's laws of motion are more easily discernible in such environments . 
this principle of equivalence was one of the foundational underpinnings for the development of the general theory of relativity . 
newton 's second law asserts the direct proportionality of acceleration to force and the inverse proportionality of acceleration to mass . 
accelerations can be defined through kinematic measurements . 
general relativity offers an equivalence between space-time and mass , but lacking a coherent theory of quantum gravity , it is unclear as to how or whether this connection is relevant on microscales .

with some justification , newton 's second law can be taken as a quantitative definition of mass by writing the law as an equality ; the relative units of force and mass then are fixed . 
newton 's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects . 
newton 's third law is a result of applying symmetry to situations where forces can be attributed to the presence of different objects . 
the third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies , -lsb- note 3 -rsb- and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body . 
f and − f are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction . 
alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system. :19 -1 
this means that in a closed system of particles , there are no internal forces that are unbalanced . 
alternatively , if an external force acts on the system , then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system. :19 -1 
since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls , this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces . 
as with other physical concepts -lrb- e.g. temperature -rrb- , the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions that are consistent with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale . 
through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics . 
through experimentation , it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by newtonian mechanics . 
because of these characteristics , forces are classified as `` vector quantities '' . 
this means that forces follow a different set of mathematical rules than physical quantities that do not have direction -lrb- denoted scalar quantities -rrb- . 
associating forces with vectors avoids such problems . 
if both of these pieces of information are not known for each force , the situation is ambiguous . 
associating forces with vectors avoids such problems . 
historically , forces were first quantitatively investigated in conditions of static equilibrium where several forces canceled each other out . 
such experiments demonstrate the crucial properties that forces are additive vector quantities : they have magnitude and direction . 
when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant -lrb- also called the net force -rrb- , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram . 
however , if the forces are acting on an extended body , their respective lines of application must also be specified in order to account for their effects on the motion of the body . 
when two forces act on a point particle , the resulting force , the resultant -lrb- also called the net force -rrb- , can be determined by following the parallelogram rule of vector addition : the addition of two vectors represented by sides of a parallelogram , gives an equivalent resultant vector that is equal in magnitude and direction to the transversal of the parallelogram . 
as well as being added , forces can also be resolved into independent components at right angles to each other . 
a horizontal force pointing northeast can therefore be split into two forces , one pointing north , and one pointing east . 
summing these component forces using vector addition yields the original force . 
this is because , for orthogonal components , the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors . 
orthogonal force vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two . 
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface . 
pushing against an object on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction , generated between the object and the table surface . 
for a situation with no movement , the static friction force exactly balances the applied force resulting in no acceleration . 
the static friction increases or decreases in response to the applied force up to an upper limit determined by the characteristics of the contact between the surface and the object . 
a static equilibrium between two forces is the most usual way of measuring forces , using simple devices such as weighing scales and spring balances . 
for example , an object suspended on a vertical spring scale experiences the force of gravity acting on the object balanced by a force applied by the `` spring reaction force '' , which equals the object 's weight .

using such tools , some quantitative force laws were discovered : that the force of gravity is proportional to volume for objects of constant density -lrb- widely exploited for millennia to define standard weights -rrb- ; archimedes ' principle for buoyancy ; archimedes ' analysis of the lever ; boyle 's law for gas pressure ; and hooke 's law for springs . 
these were all formulated and experimentally verified before isaac newton expounded his three laws of motion . 
dynamic equilibrium was first described by galileo who noticed that certain assumptions of aristotelian physics were contradicted by observations and logic . 
galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . 
galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest . 
thus , in an aristotelian universe , the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship . 
however , when this experiment is actually conducted , the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast , as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it . 
a simple case of dynamic equilibrium occurs in constant velocity motion across a surface with kinetic friction . 
in such a situation , a force is applied in the direction of motion while the kinetic friction force exactly opposes the applied force . 
however , when kinetic friction is taken into consideration it is clear that there is no net force causing constant velocity motion . 
aristotle misinterpreted this motion as being caused by the applied force . 
the notion `` force '' keeps its meaning in quantum mechanics , though one is now dealing with operators instead of classical variables and though the physics is now described by the schrödinger equation instead of newtonian equations .

however , the potentials v -lrb- x , y , z -rrb- or fields , from which the forces generally can be derived , are treated similar to classical position variables , i.e. , . 
this has the consequence that the results of a measurement are now sometimes `` quantized '' , i.e. they appear in discrete portions .

however , already in quantum mechanics there is one `` caveat '' , namely the particles acting onto each other do not only possess the spatial variable , but also a discrete intrinsic angular momentum-like variable called the `` spin '' , and there is the pauli principle relating the space and the spin variables .

depending on the value of the spin , identical particles split into two different classes , fermions and bosons . 
if two identical fermions -lrb- e.g. electrons -rrb- have a symmetric spin function -lrb- e.g. parallel spins -rrb- the spatial variables must be antisymmetric -lrb- i.e. they exclude each other from their places much as if there was a repulsive force -rrb- , and vice versa , i.e. for antiparallel spins the position variables must be symmetric -lrb- i.e. the apparent force must be attractive -rrb- .

in modern particle physics , forces and the acceleration of particles are explained as a mathematical by-product of exchange of momentum-carrying gauge bosons . 
with the development of quantum field theory and general relativity , it was realized that force is a redundant concept arising from conservation of momentum -lrb- 4-momentum in relativity and momentum of virtual particles in quantum electrodynamics -rrb- . 
the conservation of momentum can be directly derived from the homogeneity or symmetry of space and so is usually considered more fundamental than the concept of a force . 
while sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict , in full detail , the accurate result of such interactions , there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of feynman diagrams . 
in a feynman diagram , each matter particle is represented as a straight line -lrb- see world line -rrb- traveling through time , which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram . 
all of the forces in the universe are based on four fundamental interactions . 
the strong and weak forces are nuclear forces that act only at very short distances , and are responsible for the interactions between subatomic particles , including nucleons and compound nuclei . 
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses . 
the electromagnetic force acts between electric charges , and the gravitational force acts between masses . 
for example , friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces , and the pauli exclusion principle , which does not permit atoms to pass through each other . 
for example , isaac newton unified the force responsible for objects falling at the surface of the earth with the force responsible for the orbits of celestial mechanics in his universal theory of gravitation . 
in the 20th century , the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern understanding that the first three fundamental forces -lrb- all except gravity -rrb- are manifestations of matter -lrb- fermions -rrb- interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons . 
physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything .

what we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of isaac newton . 
galileo was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling objects by determining that the acceleration of every object in free-fall was constant and independent of the mass of the object . 
today , this acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the earth is usually designated as and has a magnitude of about 9.81 meters per second squared -lrb- this measurement is taken from sea level and may vary depending on location -rrb- , and points toward the center of the earth .

this observation means that the force of gravity on an object at the earth 's surface is directly proportional to the object 's mass . 
newton came to realize that the effects of gravity might be observed in different ways at larger distances . 
in particular , newton determined that the acceleration of the moon around the earth could be ascribed to the same force of gravity if the acceleration due to gravity decreased as an inverse square law . 
further , newton realized that the acceleration due to gravity is proportional to the mass of the attracting body . 
combining these ideas gives a formula that relates the mass -lrb- -rrb- and the radius -lrb- -rrb- of the earth to the gravitational acceleration : 
this constant has come to be known as newton 's universal gravitation constant , though its value was unknown in newton 's lifetime . 
not until 1798 was henry cavendish able to make the first measurement of using a torsion balance ; this was widely reported in the press as a measurement of the mass of the earth since knowing could allow one to solve for the earth 's mass given the above equation .

newton , however , realized that since all celestial bodies followed the same laws of motion , his law of gravity had to be universal . 
it was only the orbit of the planet mercury that newton 's law of gravitation seemed not to fully explain . 
some astrophysicists predicted the existence of another planet -lrb- vulcan -rrb- that would explain the discrepancies ; however , despite some early indications , no such planet could be found . 
when albert einstein formulated his theory of general relativity -lrb- gr -rrb- he turned his attention to the problem of mercury 's orbit and found that his theory added a correction , which could account for the discrepancy .

since then , and so far , general relativity has been acknowledged as the theory that best explains gravity . 
thus , the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space , and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object . 
the time derivative of the changing momentum of the object is what we label as `` gravitational force '' . 
it is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object 's curved path . 
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz 's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field . 
the connection between electricity and magnetism allows for the description of a unified electromagnetic force that acts on a charge . 
through combining the definition of electric current as the time rate of change of electric charge , a rule of vector multiplication called lorentz 's law describes the force on a charge moving in a magnetic field . 
this force can be written as a sum of the electrostatic force -lrb- due to the electric field -rrb- and the magnetic force -lrb- due to the magnetic field -rrb- . 
the origin of electric and magnetic fields would not be fully explained until 1864 when james clerk maxwell unified a number of earlier theories into a set of 20 scalar equations , which were later reformulated into 4 vector equations by oliver heaviside and josiah willard gibbs .

this led maxwell to discover that electric and magnetic fields could be `` self-generating '' through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light . 
however , attempting to reconcile electromagnetic theory with two observations , the photoelectric effect , and the nonexistence of the ultraviolet catastrophe , proved troublesome . 
through the work of leading theoretical physicists , a new theory of electromagnetism was developed using quantum mechanics . 
this final modification to electromagnetic theory ultimately led to quantum electrodynamics -lrb- or qed -rrb- , which fully describes all electromagnetic phenomena as being mediated by wave -- particles known as photons .

it is a common misconception to ascribe the stiffness and rigidity of solid matter to the repulsion of like charges under the influence of the electromagnetic force . 
however , these characteristics actually result from the pauli exclusion principle . 
this means that it takes energy to pack them together . 
while this effect is manifested macroscopically as a structural force , it is technically only the result of the existence of a finite set of electron states .

the strong force only acts directly upon elementary particles .

here the strong force acts indirectly , transmitted as gluons , which form part of the virtual pi and rho mesons , which classically transmit the nuclear force -lrb- see this topic for more -rrb- . 
this phenomenon is called color confinement . 
the weak force is due to the exchange of the heavy w and z bosons . 
its most familiar effect is beta decay -lrb- of neutrons in atomic nuclei -rrb- and the associated radioactivity .

the word `` weak '' derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force . 
a consistent electroweak theory has also been developed , which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins . 
the normal force is due to repulsive forces of interaction between atoms at close contact . 
when their electron clouds overlap , pauli repulsion -lrb- due to fermionic nature of electrons -rrb- follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. :93 the normal force , for example , is responsible for the structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object .

tension forces can be modeled using ideal strings that are massless , frictionless , unbreakable , and unstretchable . 
they can be combined with ideal pulleys , which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction . 
ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string , any force directed along the string by the first object is accompanied by a force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object . 
these tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine . 
by connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys , the tension force on a load can be multiplied . 
newton 's laws and newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects .

for example , in extended fluids , differences in pressure result in forces being directed along the pressure gradients as follows :

the stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains -lrb- deformations -rrb- including also tensile stresses and compressions. :133 -- 134:38 -1 -- 38-11 
this formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area -lrb- the matrix diagonals of the tensor -rrb- as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area -lrb- the off-diagonal elements -rrb- .

torque is the rotation equivalent of force in the same way that angle is the rotational equivalent for position , angular velocity for velocity , and angular momentum for momentum . 
as a consequence of newton 's first law of motion , there exists rotational inertia that ensures that all bodies maintain their angular momentum unless acted upon by an unbalanced torque . 
likewise , newton 's second law of motion can be used to derive an analogous equation for the instantaneous angular acceleration of the rigid body : 
this means that the unbalanced centripetal force felt by any object is always directed toward the center of the curving path . 
such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the motion of an object , and therefore do not change the speed of the object -lrb- magnitude of the velocity -rrb- , but only the direction of the velocity vector . 
this yields both the tangential force , which accelerates the object by either slowing it down or speeding it up , and the radial -lrb- centripetal -rrb- force , which changes its direction .

a conservative force that acts on a closed system has an associated mechanical work that allows energy to convert only between kinetic or potential forms . 
this means that for a closed system , the net mechanical energy is conserved whenever a conservative force acts on the system . 
the force , therefore , is related directly to the difference in potential energy between two different locations in space , and can be considered to be an artifact of the potential field in the same way that the direction and amount of a flow of water can be considered to be an artifact of the contour map of the elevation of an area .

for example , friction is caused by the gradients of numerous electrostatic potentials between the atoms , but manifests as a force model that is independent of any macroscale position vector . 
nonconservative forces other than friction include other contact forces , tension , compression , and drag . 
the connection between macroscopic nonconservative forces and microscopic conservative forces is described by detailed treatment with statistical mechanics . 
in macroscopic closed systems , nonconservative forces act to change the internal energies of the system , and are often associated with the transfer of heat .
